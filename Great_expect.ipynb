family name being pirrip and my christian name philip my\\ninfant tongue could make of both names nothing longer or more explicit\\nthan pip so i called myself pip and came to be called pip\\n\\ni give pirrip as my fatherâ\\x80\\x99s family name on the authority of his\\ntombstone and my sisterâ\\x80\\x94mrs joe gargery who married the blacksmith\\nas i never saw my father or my mother and never saw any likeness of\\neither of them for their days were long before the days of\\nphotographs my first fancies regarding what they were like were\\nunreasonably derived from their tombstones the shape of the letters on\\nmy fatherâ\\x80\\x99s gave me an odd idea that he was a square stout dark man\\nwith curly black hair from the character and turn of the inscription\\nâ\\x80\\x9calso georgiana wife of the aboveâ\\x80\\x9d i drew a childish conclusion that\\nmy mother was freckled and sickly to five little stone lozenges each\\nabout a foot and a half long which were arranged in a neat row beside\\ntheir grave and were sacred to the memory of five little brothers of\\nmineâ\\x80\\x94who gave up trying to get a living exceedingly early in that\\nuniversal struggleâ\\x80\\x94i am indebted for a belief i religiously\\nentertained that they had all been born on their backs with their hands\\nin their trouserspockets and had never taken them out in this state\\nof existence\\n\\nours was the marsh country down by the river within as the river\\nwound twenty miles of the sea my first most vivid and broad\\nimpression of the identity of things seems to me to have been gained on\\na memorable raw afternoon towards evening at such a time i found out\\nfor certain that this bleak place overgrown with nettles was the\\nchurchyard and that philip pirrip late of this parish and also\\ngeorgiana wife of the above were dead and buried and that alexander\\nbartholomew abraham tobias and roger infant children of the\\naforesaid were also dead and buried and that the dark flat wilderness\\nbeyond the churchyard intersected with dikes and mounds and gates\\nwith scattered cattle feeding on it was the marshes and that the low\\nleaden line beyond was the river and that the distant savage lair from\\nwhich the wind was rushing was the sea and that the small bundle of\\nshivers growing afraid of it all and beginning to cry was pip\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9chold your noiseâ\\x80\\x9d cried a terrible voice as a man started up from\\namong the graves at the side of the church porch â\\x80\\x9ckeep still you\\nlittle devil or iâ\\x80\\x99ll cut your throatâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\na fearful man all in coarse grey with a great iron on his leg a man\\nwith no hat and with broken shoes and with an old rag tied round his\\nhead a man who had been soaked in water and smothered in mud and\\nlamed by stones and cut by flints and stung by nettles and torn by\\nbriars who limped and shivered and glared and growled and whose\\nteeth chattered in his head as he seized me by the chin\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9coh donâ\\x80\\x99t cut my throat sirâ\\x80\\x9d i pleaded in terror â\\x80\\x9cpray donâ\\x80\\x99t do it\\nsirâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ctell us your nameâ\\x80\\x9d said the man â\\x80\\x9cquickâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cpip sirâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9conce moreâ\\x80\\x9d said the man staring at me â\\x80\\x9cgive it mouthâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cpip pip sirâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cshow us where you liveâ\\x80\\x9d said the man â\\x80\\x9cpint out the placeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni pointed to where our village lay on the flat inshore among the\\naldertrees and pollards a mile or more from the church\\n\\nthe man after looking at me for a moment turned me upside down and\\nemptied my pockets there was nothing in them but a piece of bread\\nwhen the church came to itselfâ\\x80\\x94for he was so sudden and strong that he\\nmade it go head over heels before me and i saw the steeple under my\\nfeetâ\\x80\\x94when the church came to itself i say i was seated on a high\\ntombstone trembling while he ate the bread ravenously\\n\\nillustration\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou young dogâ\\x80\\x9d said the man licking his lips â\\x80\\x9cwhat fat cheeks you\\nhaâ\\x80\\x99 gotâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni believe they were fat though i was at that time undersized for my\\nyears and not strong\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cdarn me if i couldnâ\\x80\\x99t eat â\\x80\\x99emâ\\x80\\x9d said the man with a threatening shake\\nof his head â\\x80\\x9cand if i hanâ\\x80\\x99t half a mind toâ\\x80\\x99tâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni earnestly expressed my hope that he wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t and held tighter to the\\ntombstone on which he had put me partly to keep myself upon it\\npartly to keep myself from crying\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnow lookee hereâ\\x80\\x9d said the man â\\x80\\x9cwhereâ\\x80\\x99s your motherâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthere sirâ\\x80\\x9d said i\\n\\nhe started made a short run and stopped and looked over his shoulder\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthere sirâ\\x80\\x9d i timidly explained â\\x80\\x9calso georgiana thatâ\\x80\\x99s my motherâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cohâ\\x80\\x9d said he coming back â\\x80\\x9cand is that your father alonger your\\nmotherâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyes sirâ\\x80\\x9d said i â\\x80\\x9chim too late of this parishâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9chaâ\\x80\\x9d he muttered then considering â\\x80\\x9cwho dâ\\x80\\x99ye live withâ\\x80\\x94supposinâ\\x80\\x99\\nyouâ\\x80\\x99re kindly let to live which i hanâ\\x80\\x99t made up my mind aboutâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmy sister sirâ\\x80\\x94mrs joe gargeryâ\\x80\\x94wife of joe gargery the blacksmith\\nsirâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cblacksmith ehâ\\x80\\x9d said he and looked down at his leg\\n\\nafter darkly looking at his leg and me several times he came closer to\\nmy tombstone took me by both arms and tilted me back as far as he\\ncould hold me so that his eyes looked most powerfully down into mine\\nand mine looked most helplessly up into his\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnow lookee hereâ\\x80\\x9d he said â\\x80\\x9cthe question being whether youâ\\x80\\x99re to be\\nlet to live you know what a file isâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyes sirâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cand you know what wittles isâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyes sirâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nafter each question he tilted me over a little more so as to give me a\\ngreater sense of helplessness and danger\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou get me a fileâ\\x80\\x9d he tilted me again â\\x80\\x9cand you get me wittlesâ\\x80\\x9d he\\ntilted me again â\\x80\\x9cyou bring â\\x80\\x99em both to meâ\\x80\\x9d he tilted me again â\\x80\\x9cor\\niâ\\x80\\x99ll have your heart and liver outâ\\x80\\x9d he tilted me again\\n\\ni was dreadfully frightened and so giddy that i clung to him with both\\nhands and said â\\x80\\x9cif you would kindly please to let me keep upright\\nsir perhaps i shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t be sick and perhaps i could attend moreâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nhe gave me a most tremendous dip and roll so that the church jumped\\nover its own weathercock then he held me by the arms in an upright\\nposition on the top of the stone and went on in these fearful termsâ\\x80\\x94\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou bring me tomorrow morning early that file and them wittles you\\nbring the lot to me at that old battery over yonder you do it and\\nyou never dare to say a word or dare to make a sign concerning your\\nhaving seen such a person as me or any person sumever and you shall\\nbe let to live you fail or you go from my words in any partickler no\\nmatter how small it is and your heart and your liver shall be tore\\nout roasted and ate now i ainâ\\x80\\x99t alone as you may think i am\\nthereâ\\x80\\x99s a young man hid with me in comparison with which young man i\\nam a angel that young man hears the words i speak that young man has\\na secret way pecooliar to himself of getting at a boy and at his\\nheart and at his liver it is in wain for a boy to attempt to hide\\nhimself from that young man a boy may lock his door may be warm in\\nbed may tuck himself up may draw the clothes over his head may think\\nhimself comfortable and safe but that young man will softly creep and\\ncreep his way to him and tear him open i am a keeping that young man\\nfrom harming of you at the present moment with great difficulty i\\nfind it wery hard to hold that young man off of your inside now what\\ndo you sayâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni said that i would get him the file and i would get him what broken\\nbits of food i could and i would come to him at the battery early in\\nthe morning\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9csay lord strike you dead if you donâ\\x80\\x99tâ\\x80\\x9d said the man\\n\\ni said so and he took me down\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnowâ\\x80\\x9d he pursued â\\x80\\x9cyou remember what youâ\\x80\\x99ve undertook and you\\nremember that young man and you get homeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cgoogood night sirâ\\x80\\x9d i faltered\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmuch of thatâ\\x80\\x9d said he glancing about him over the cold wet flat â\\x80\\x9ci\\nwish i was a frog or a eelâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nat the same time he hugged his shuddering body in both his\\narmsâ\\x80\\x94clasping himself as if to hold himself togetherâ\\x80\\x94and limped\\ntowards the low church wall as i saw him go picking his way among the\\nnettles and among the brambles that bound the green mounds he looked\\nin my young eyes as if he were eluding the hands of the dead people\\nstretching up cautiously out of their graves to get a twist upon his\\nankle and pull him in\\n\\nwhen he came to the low church wall he got over it like a man whose\\nlegs were numbed and stiff and then turned round to look for me when\\ni saw him turning i set my face towards home and made the best use of\\nmy legs but presently i looked over my shoulder and saw him going on\\nagain towards the river still hugging himself in both arms and\\npicking his way with his sore feet among the great stones dropped into\\nthe marshes here and there for steppingplaces when the rains were\\nheavy or the tide was in\\n\\nthe marshes were just a long black horizontal line then as i stopped\\nto look after him and the river was just another horizontal line not\\nnearly so broad nor yet so black and the sky was just a row of long\\nangry red lines and dense black lines intermixed on the edge of the\\nriver i could faintly make out the only two black things in all the\\nprospect that seemed to be standing upright one of these was the\\nbeacon by which the sailors steeredâ\\x80\\x94like an unhooped cask upon a\\npoleâ\\x80\\x94an ugly thing when you were near it the other a gibbet with\\nsome chains hanging to it which had once held a pirate the man was\\nlimping on towards this latter as if he were the pirate come to life\\nand come down and going back to hook himself up again it gave me a\\nterrible turn when i thought so and as i saw the cattle lifting their\\nheads to gaze after him i wondered whether they thought so too i\\nlooked all round for the horrible young man and could see no signs of\\nhim but now i was frightened again and ran home without stopping\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter ii\\n\\n\\nmy sister mrs joe gargery was more than twenty years older than i\\nand had established a great reputation with herself and the neighbours\\nbecause she had brought me up â\\x80\\x9cby handâ\\x80\\x9d having at that time to find\\nout for myself what the expression meant and knowing her to have a\\nhard and heavy hand and to be much in the habit of laying it upon her\\nhusband as well as upon me i supposed that joe gargery and i were both\\nbrought up by hand\\n\\nshe was not a goodlooking woman my sister and i had a general\\nimpression that she must have made joe gargery marry her by hand joe\\nwas a fair man with curls of flaxen hair on each side of his smooth\\nface and with eyes of such a very undecided blue that they seemed to\\nhave somehow got mixed with their own whites he was a mild\\ngoodnatured sweettempered easygoing foolish dear fellowâ\\x80\\x94a sort\\nof hercules in strength and also in weakness\\n\\nmy sister mrs joe with black hair and eyes had such a prevailing\\nredness of skin that i sometimes used to wonder whether it was possible\\nshe washed herself with a nutmeggrater instead of soap she was tall\\nand bony and almost always wore a coarse apron fastened over her\\nfigure behind with two loops and having a square impregnable bib in\\nfront that was stuck full of pins and needles she made it a powerful\\nmerit in herself and a strong reproach against joe that she wore this\\napron so much though i really see no reason why she should have worn\\nit at all or why if she did wear it at all she should not have taken\\nit off every day of her life\\n\\njoeâ\\x80\\x99s forge adjoined our house which was a wooden house as many of\\nthe dwellings in our country wereâ\\x80\\x94most of them at that time when i\\nran home from the churchyard the forge was shut up and joe was\\nsitting alone in the kitchen joe and i being fellowsufferers and\\nhaving confidences as such joe imparted a confidence to me the moment\\ni raised the latch of the door and peeped in at him opposite to it\\nsitting in the chimney corner\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmrs joe has been out a dozen times looking for you pip and sheâ\\x80\\x99s\\nout now making it a bakerâ\\x80\\x99s dozenâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cis sheâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyes pipâ\\x80\\x9d said joe â\\x80\\x9cand whatâ\\x80\\x99s worse sheâ\\x80\\x99s got tickler with herâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nat this dismal intelligence i twisted the only button on my waistcoat\\nround and round and looked in great depression at the fire tickler\\nwas a waxended piece of cane worn smooth by collision with my tickled\\nframe\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cshe sot downâ\\x80\\x9d said joe â\\x80\\x9cand she got up and she made a grab at\\ntickler and she rampaged out thatâ\\x80\\x99s what she didâ\\x80\\x9d said joe slowly\\nclearing the fire between the lower bars with the poker and looking at\\nit â\\x80\\x9cshe rampaged out pipâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9chas she been gone long joeâ\\x80\\x9d i always treated him as a larger species\\nof child and as no more than my equal\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwellâ\\x80\\x9d said joe glancing up at the dutch clock â\\x80\\x9csheâ\\x80\\x99s been on the\\nrampage this last spell about five minutes pip sheâ\\x80\\x99s acoming get\\nbehind the door old chap and have the jacktowel betwixt youâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni took the advice my sister mrs joe throwing the door wide open\\nand finding an obstruction behind it immediately divined the cause\\nand applied tickler to its further investigation she concluded by\\nthrowing meâ\\x80\\x94i often served as a connubial missileâ\\x80\\x94at joe who glad to\\nget hold of me on any terms passed me on into the chimney and quietly\\nfenced me up there with his great leg\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhere have you been you young monkeyâ\\x80\\x9d said mrs joe stamping her\\nfoot â\\x80\\x9ctell me directly what youâ\\x80\\x99ve been doing to wear me away with\\nfret and fright and worrit or iâ\\x80\\x99d have you out of that corner if you\\nwas fifty pips and he was five hundred gargerysâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci have only been to the churchyardâ\\x80\\x9d said i from my stool crying and\\nrubbing myself\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cchurchyardâ\\x80\\x9d repeated my sister â\\x80\\x9cif it warnâ\\x80\\x99t for me youâ\\x80\\x99d have been\\nto the churchyard long ago and stayed there who brought you up by\\nhandâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou didâ\\x80\\x9d said i\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cand why did i do it i should like to knowâ\\x80\\x9d exclaimed my sister\\n\\ni whimpered â\\x80\\x9ci donâ\\x80\\x99t knowâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci donâ\\x80\\x99tâ\\x80\\x9d said my sister â\\x80\\x9ciâ\\x80\\x99d never do it again i know that i may\\ntruly say iâ\\x80\\x99ve never had this apron of mine off since born you were\\nitâ\\x80\\x99s bad enough to be a blacksmithâ\\x80\\x99s wife and him a gargery without\\nbeing your motherâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nmy thoughts strayed from that question as i looked disconsolately at\\nthe fire for the fugitive out on the marshes with the ironed leg the\\nmysterious young man the file the food and the dreadful pledge i was\\nunder to commit a larceny on those sheltering premises rose before me\\nin the avenging coals\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9chahâ\\x80\\x9d said mrs joe restoring tickler to his station â\\x80\\x9cchurchyard\\nindeed you may well say churchyard you twoâ\\x80\\x9d one of us by the by\\nhad not said it at all â\\x80\\x9cyouâ\\x80\\x99ll drive me to the churchyard betwixt\\nyou one of these days and o a prrrecious pair youâ\\x80\\x99d be without\\nmeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nas she applied herself to set the teathings joe peeped down at me\\nover his leg as if he were mentally casting me and himself up and\\ncalculating what kind of pair we practically should make under the\\ngrievous circumstances foreshadowed after that he sat feeling his\\nrightside flaxen curls and whisker and following mrs joe about with\\nhis blue eyes as his manner always was at squally times\\n\\nmy sister had a trenchant way of cutting our bread and butter for us\\nthat never varied first with her left hand she jammed the loaf hard\\nand fast against her bibâ\\x80\\x94where it sometimes got a pin into it and\\nsometimes a needle which we afterwards got into our mouths then she\\ntook some butter not too much on a knife and spread it on the loaf\\nin an apothecary kind of way as if she were making a plasterâ\\x80\\x94using\\nboth sides of the knife with a slapping dexterity and trimming and\\nmoulding the butter off round the crust then she gave the knife a\\nfinal smart wipe on the edge of the plaster and then sawed a very\\nthick round off the loaf which she finally before separating from the\\nloaf hewed into two halves of which joe got one and i the other\\n\\non the present occasion though i was hungry i dared not eat my slice\\ni felt that i must have something in reserve for my dreadful\\nacquaintance and his ally the still more dreadful young man i knew\\nmrs joeâ\\x80\\x99s housekeeping to be of the strictest kind and that my\\nlarcenous researches might find nothing available in the safe\\ntherefore i resolved to put my hunk of bread and butter down the leg of\\nmy trousers\\n\\nthe effort of resolution necessary to the achievement of this purpose i\\nfound to be quite awful it was as if i had to make up my mind to leap\\nfrom the top of a high house or plunge into a great depth of water\\nand it was made the more difficult by the unconscious joe in our\\nalreadymentioned freemasonry as fellowsufferers and in his\\ngoodnatured companionship with me it was our evening habit to compare\\nthe way we bit through our slices by silently holding them up to each\\notherâ\\x80\\x99s admiration now and thenâ\\x80\\x94which stimulated us to new exertions\\ntonight joe several times invited me by the display of his fast\\ndiminishing slice to enter upon our usual friendly competition but he\\nfound me each time with my yellow mug of tea on one knee and my\\nuntouched bread and butter on the other at last i desperately\\nconsidered that the thing i contemplated must be done and that it had\\nbest be done in the least improbable manner consistent with the\\ncircumstances i took advantage of a moment when joe had just looked at\\nme and got my bread and butter down my leg\\n\\njoe was evidently made uncomfortable by what he supposed to be my loss\\nof appetite and took a thoughtful bite out of his slice which he\\ndidnâ\\x80\\x99t seem to enjoy he turned it about in his mouth much longer than\\nusual pondering over it a good deal and after all gulped it down like\\na pill he was about to take another bite and had just got his head on\\none side for a good purchase on it when his eye fell on me and he saw\\nthat my bread and butter was gone\\n\\nthe wonder and consternation with which joe stopped on the threshold of\\nhis bite and stared at me were too evident to escape my sisterâ\\x80\\x99s\\nobservation\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhatâ\\x80\\x99s the matter nowâ\\x80\\x9d said she smartly as she put down her cup\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci say you knowâ\\x80\\x9d muttered joe shaking his head at me in very serious\\nremonstrance â\\x80\\x9cpip old chap youâ\\x80\\x99ll do yourself a mischief itâ\\x80\\x99ll\\nstick somewhere you canâ\\x80\\x99t have chawed it pipâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhatâ\\x80\\x99s the matter nowâ\\x80\\x9d repeated my sister more sharply than before\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cif you can cough any trifle on it up pip iâ\\x80\\x99d recommend you to do\\nitâ\\x80\\x9d said joe all aghast â\\x80\\x9cmanners is manners but still your elthâ\\x80\\x99s\\nyour elthâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nby this time my sister was quite desperate so she pounced on joe\\nand taking him by the two whiskers knocked his head for a little\\nwhile against the wall behind him while i sat in the corner looking\\nguiltily on\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnow perhaps youâ\\x80\\x99ll mention whatâ\\x80\\x99s the matterâ\\x80\\x9d said my sister out of\\nbreath â\\x80\\x9cyou staring great stuck pigâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\njoe looked at her in a helpless way then took a helpless bite and\\nlooked at me again\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou know pipâ\\x80\\x9d said joe solemnly with his last bite in his cheek\\nand speaking in a confidential voice as if we two were quite alone\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou and me is always friends and iâ\\x80\\x99d be the last to tell upon you\\nany time but such aâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d he moved his chair and looked about the floor\\nbetween us and then again at meâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9csuch a most oncommon bolt as thatâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbeen bolting his food has heâ\\x80\\x9d cried my sister\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou know old chapâ\\x80\\x9d said joe looking at me and not at mrs joe\\nwith his bite still in his cheek â\\x80\\x9ci bolted myself when i was your\\nageâ\\x80\\x94frequentâ\\x80\\x94and as a boy iâ\\x80\\x99ve been among a many bolters but i never\\nsee your bolting equal yet pip and itâ\\x80\\x99s a mercy you ainâ\\x80\\x99t bolted\\ndeadâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nmy sister made a dive at me and fished me up by the hair saying\\nnothing more than the awful words â\\x80\\x9cyou come along and be dosedâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nsome medical beast had revived tarwater in those days as a fine\\nmedicine and mrs joe always kept a supply of it in the cupboard\\nhaving a belief in its virtues correspondent to its nastiness at the\\nbest of times so much of this elixir was administered to me as a\\nchoice restorative that i was conscious of going about smelling like\\na new fence on this particular evening the urgency of my case demanded\\na pint of this mixture which was poured down my throat for my greater\\ncomfort while mrs joe held my head under her arm as a boot would be\\nheld in a bootjack joe got off with half a pint but was made to\\nswallow that much to his disturbance as he sat slowly munching and\\nmeditating before the fire â\\x80\\x9cbecause he had had a turnâ\\x80\\x9d judging from\\nmyself i should say he certainly had a turn afterwards if he had had\\nnone before\\n\\nconscience is a dreadful thing when it accuses man or boy but when in\\nthe case of a boy that secret burden cooperates with another secret\\nburden down the leg of his trousers it is as i can testify a great\\npunishment the guilty knowledge that i was going to rob mrs joeâ\\x80\\x94i\\nnever thought i was going to rob joe for i never thought of any of the\\nhousekeeping property as hisâ\\x80\\x94united to the necessity of always keeping\\none hand on my bread and butter as i sat or when i was ordered about\\nthe kitchen on any small errand almost drove me out of my mind then\\nas the marsh winds made the fire glow and flare i thought i heard the\\nvoice outside of the man with the iron on his leg who had sworn me to\\nsecrecy declaring that he couldnâ\\x80\\x99t and wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t starve until\\ntomorrow but must be fed now at other times i thought what if the\\nyoung man who was with so much difficulty restrained from imbruing his\\nhands in me should yield to a constitutional impatience or should\\nmistake the time and should think himself accredited to my heart and\\nliver tonight instead of tomorrow if ever anybodyâ\\x80\\x99s hair stood on\\nend with terror mine must have done so then but perhaps nobodyâ\\x80\\x99s\\never did\\n\\nit was christmas eve and i had to stir the pudding for next day with\\na copperstick from seven to eight by the dutch clock i tried it with\\nthe load upon my leg and that made me think afresh of the man with the\\nload on his leg and found the tendency of exercise to bring the\\nbread and butter out at my ankle quite unmanageable happily i slipped\\naway and deposited that part of my conscience in my garret bedroom\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9charkâ\\x80\\x9d said i when i had done my stirring and was taking a final\\nwarm in the chimney corner before being sent up to bed â\\x80\\x9cwas that great\\nguns joeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cahâ\\x80\\x9d said joe â\\x80\\x9cthereâ\\x80\\x99s another conwict offâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhat does that mean joeâ\\x80\\x9d said i\\n\\nmrs joe who always took explanations upon herself said snappishly\\nâ\\x80\\x9cescaped escapedâ\\x80\\x9d administering the definition like tarwater\\n\\nwhile mrs joe sat with her head bending over her needlework i put my\\nmouth into the forms of saying to joe â\\x80\\x9cwhatâ\\x80\\x99s a convictâ\\x80\\x9d joe put\\nhis mouth into the forms of returning such a highly elaborate answer\\nthat i could make out nothing of it but the single word â\\x80\\x9cpipâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthere was a conwict off last nightâ\\x80\\x9d said joe aloud â\\x80\\x9cafter\\nsunsetgun and they fired warning of him and now it appears theyâ\\x80\\x99re\\nfiring warning of anotherâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhoâ\\x80\\x99s firingâ\\x80\\x9d said i\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cdrat that boyâ\\x80\\x9d interposed my sister frowning at me over her work\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhat a questioner he is ask no questions and youâ\\x80\\x99ll be told no\\nliesâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nit was not very polite to herself i thought to imply that i should be\\ntold lies by her even if i did ask questions but she never was polite\\nunless there was company\\n\\nat this point joe greatly augmented my curiosity by taking the utmost\\npains to open his mouth very wide and to put it into the form of a\\nword that looked to me like â\\x80\\x9csulksâ\\x80\\x9d therefore i naturally pointed to\\nmrs joe and put my mouth into the form of saying â\\x80\\x9cherâ\\x80\\x9d but joe\\nwouldnâ\\x80\\x99t hear of that at all and again opened his mouth very wide\\nand shook the form of a most emphatic word out of it but i could make\\nnothing of the word\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmrs joeâ\\x80\\x9d said i as a last resort â\\x80\\x9ci should like to knowâ\\x80\\x94if you\\nwouldnâ\\x80\\x99t much mindâ\\x80\\x94where the firing comes fromâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9clord bless the boyâ\\x80\\x9d exclaimed my sister as if she didnâ\\x80\\x99t quite mean\\nthat but rather the contrary â\\x80\\x9cfrom the hulksâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cohhâ\\x80\\x9d said i looking at joe â\\x80\\x9chulksâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\njoe gave a reproachful cough as much as to say â\\x80\\x9cwell i told you soâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cand please whatâ\\x80\\x99s hulksâ\\x80\\x9d said i\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthatâ\\x80\\x99s the way with this boyâ\\x80\\x9d exclaimed my sister pointing me out\\nwith her needle and thread and shaking her head at me â\\x80\\x9canswer him one\\nquestion and heâ\\x80\\x99ll ask you a dozen directly hulks are prisonships\\nright â\\x80\\x99cross thâ\\x80\\x99 meshesâ\\x80\\x9d we always used that name for marshes in our\\ncountry\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci wonder whoâ\\x80\\x99s put into prisonships and why theyâ\\x80\\x99re put thereâ\\x80\\x9d said\\ni in a general way and with quiet desperation\\n\\nit was too much for mrs joe who immediately rose â\\x80\\x9ci tell you what\\nyoung fellowâ\\x80\\x9d said she â\\x80\\x9ci didnâ\\x80\\x99t bring you up by hand to badger\\npeopleâ\\x80\\x99s lives out it would be blame to me and not praise if i had\\npeople are put in the hulks because they murder and because they rob\\nand forge and do all sorts of bad and they always begin by asking\\nquestions now you get along to bedâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni was never allowed a candle to light me to bed and as i went\\nupstairs in the dark with my head tinglingâ\\x80\\x94from mrs joeâ\\x80\\x99s thimble\\nhaving played the tambourine upon it to accompany her last wordsâ\\x80\\x94i\\nfelt fearfully sensible of the great convenience that the hulks were\\nhandy for me i was clearly on my way there i had begun by asking\\nquestions and i was going to rob mrs joe\\n\\nsince that time which is far enough away now i have often thought\\nthat few people know what secrecy there is in the young under terror\\nno matter how unreasonable the terror so that it be terror i was in\\nmortal terror of the young man who wanted my heart and liver i was in\\nmortal terror of my interlocutor with the iron leg i was in mortal\\nterror of myself from whom an awful promise had been extracted i had\\nno hope of deliverance through my allpowerful sister who repulsed me\\nat every turn i am afraid to think of what i might have done on\\nrequirement in the secrecy of my terror\\n\\nif i slept at all that night it was only to imagine myself drifting\\ndown the river on a strong springtide to the hulks a ghostly pirate\\ncalling out to me through a speakingtrumpet as i passed the\\ngibbetstation that i had better come ashore and be hanged there at\\nonce and not put it off i was afraid to sleep even if i had been\\ninclined for i knew that at the first faint dawn of morning i must rob\\nthe pantry there was no doing it in the night for there was no\\ngetting a light by easy friction then to have got one i must have\\nstruck it out of flint and steel and have made a noise like the very\\npirate himself rattling his chains\\n\\nas soon as the great black velvet pall outside my little window was\\nshot with grey i got up and went downstairs every board upon the way\\nand every crack in every board calling after me â\\x80\\x9cstop thiefâ\\x80\\x9d and â\\x80\\x9cget\\nup mrs joeâ\\x80\\x9d in the pantry which was far more abundantly supplied\\nthan usual owing to the season i was very much alarmed by a hare\\nhanging up by the heels whom i rather thought i caught when my back\\nwas half turned winking i had no time for verification no time for\\nselection no time for anything for i had no time to spare i stole\\nsome bread some rind of cheese about half a jar of mincemeat which i\\ntied up in my pockethandkerchief with my last nightâ\\x80\\x99s slice some\\nbrandy from a stone bottle which i decanted into a glass bottle i had\\nsecretly used for making that intoxicating fluid\\nspanishliquoricewater up in my room diluting the stone bottle from\\na jug in the kitchen cupboard a meat bone with very little on it and\\na beautiful round compact pork pie i was nearly going away without the\\npie but i was tempted to mount upon a shelf to look what it was that\\nwas put away so carefully in a covered earthenware dish in a corner\\nand i found it was the pie and i took it in the hope that it was not\\nintended for early use and would not be missed for some time\\n\\nthere was a door in the kitchen communicating with the forge i\\nunlocked and unbolted that door and got a file from among joeâ\\x80\\x99s tools\\nthen i put the fastenings as i had found them opened the door at which\\ni had entered when i ran home last night shut it and ran for the\\nmisty marshes\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter iii\\n\\n\\nit was a rimy morning and very damp i had seen the damp lying on the\\noutside of my little window as if some goblin had been crying there\\nall night and using the window for a pockethandkerchief now i saw\\nthe damp lying on the bare hedges and spare grass like a coarser sort\\nof spidersâ\\x80\\x99 webs hanging itself from twig to twig and blade to blade\\non every rail and gate wet lay clammy and the marsh mist was so\\nthick that the wooden finger on the post directing people to our\\nvillageâ\\x80\\x94a direction which they never accepted for they never came\\nthereâ\\x80\\x94was invisible to me until i was quite close under it then as i\\nlooked up at it while it dripped it seemed to my oppressed conscience\\nlike a phantom devoting me to the hulks\\n\\nthe mist was heavier yet when i got out upon the marshes so that\\ninstead of my running at everything everything seemed to run at me\\nthis was very disagreeable to a guilty mind the gates and dikes and\\nbanks came bursting at me through the mist as if they cried as plainly\\nas could be â\\x80\\x9ca boy with somebody elseâ\\x80\\x99s pork pie stop himâ\\x80\\x9d the\\ncattle came upon me with like suddenness staring out of their eyes\\nand steaming out of their nostrils â\\x80\\x9challoa young thiefâ\\x80\\x9d one black\\nox with a white cravat onâ\\x80\\x94who even had to my awakened conscience\\nsomething of a clerical airâ\\x80\\x94fixed me so obstinately with his eyes and\\nmoved his blunt head round in such an accusatory manner as i moved\\nround that i blubbered out to him â\\x80\\x9ci couldnâ\\x80\\x99t help it sir it wasnâ\\x80\\x99t\\nfor myself i took itâ\\x80\\x9d upon which he put down his head blew a cloud of\\nsmoke out of his nose and vanished with a kickup of his hindlegs and\\na flourish of his tail\\n\\nall this time i was getting on towards the river but however fast i\\nwent i couldnâ\\x80\\x99t warm my feet to which the damp cold seemed riveted\\nas the iron was riveted to the leg of the man i was running to meet i\\nknew my way to the battery pretty straight for i had been down there\\non a sunday with joe and joe sitting on an old gun had told me that\\nwhen i was â\\x80\\x99prentice to him regularly bound we would have such larks\\nthere however in the confusion of the mist i found myself at last\\ntoo far to the right and consequently had to try back along the\\nriverside on the bank of loose stones above the mud and the stakes\\nthat staked the tide out making my way along here with all despatch i\\nhad just crossed a ditch which i knew to be very near the battery and\\nhad just scrambled up the mound beyond the ditch when i saw the man\\nsitting before me his back was towards me and he had his arms folded\\nand was nodding forward heavy with sleep\\n\\ni thought he would be more glad if i came upon him with his breakfast\\nin that unexpected manner so i went forward softly and touched him on\\nthe shoulder he instantly jumped up and it was not the same man but\\nanother man\\n\\nand yet this man was dressed in coarse grey too and had a great iron\\non his leg and was lame and hoarse and cold and was everything that\\nthe other man was except that he had not the same face and had a flat\\nbroadbrimmed lowcrowned felt hat on all this i saw in a moment for\\ni had only a moment to see it in he swore an oath at me made a hit at\\nmeâ\\x80\\x94it was a round weak blow that missed me and almost knocked himself\\ndown for it made him stumbleâ\\x80\\x94and then he ran into the mist stumbling\\ntwice as he went and i lost him\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s the young manâ\\x80\\x9d i thought feeling my heart shoot as i identified\\nhim i dare say i should have felt a pain in my liver too if i had\\nknown where it was\\n\\ni was soon at the battery after that and there was the right\\nmanâ\\x80\\x94hugging himself and limping to and fro as if he had never all\\nnight left off hugging and limpingâ\\x80\\x94waiting for me he was awfully\\ncold to be sure i half expected to see him drop down before my face\\nand die of deadly cold his eyes looked so awfully hungry too that\\nwhen i handed him the file and he laid it down on the grass it\\noccurred to me he would have tried to eat it if he had not seen my\\nbundle he did not turn me upside down this time to get at what i had\\nbut left me right side upwards while i opened the bundle and emptied my\\npockets\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhatâ\\x80\\x99s in the bottle boyâ\\x80\\x9d said he\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbrandyâ\\x80\\x9d said i\\n\\nhe was already handing mincemeat down his throat in the most curious\\nmannerâ\\x80\\x94more like a man who was putting it away somewhere in a violent\\nhurry than a man who was eating itâ\\x80\\x94but he left off to take some of\\nthe liquor he shivered all the while so violently that it was quite\\nas much as he could do to keep the neck of the bottle between his\\nteeth without biting it off\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci think you have got the agueâ\\x80\\x9d said i\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ciâ\\x80\\x99m much of your opinion boyâ\\x80\\x9d said he\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s bad about hereâ\\x80\\x9d i told him â\\x80\\x9cyouâ\\x80\\x99ve been lying out on the\\nmeshes and theyâ\\x80\\x99re dreadful aguish rheumatic tooâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ciâ\\x80\\x99ll eat my breakfast afore theyâ\\x80\\x99re the death of meâ\\x80\\x9d said he â\\x80\\x9ciâ\\x80\\x99d do\\nthat if i was going to be strung up to that there gallows as there is\\nover there directly afterwards iâ\\x80\\x99ll beat the shivers so far iâ\\x80\\x99ll bet\\nyouâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nhe was gobbling mincemeat meatbone bread cheese and pork pie all\\nat once staring distrustfully while he did so at the mist all round\\nus and often stoppingâ\\x80\\x94even stopping his jawsâ\\x80\\x94to listen some real or\\nfancied sound some clink upon the river or breathing of beast upon the\\nmarsh now gave him a start and he said suddenlyâ\\x80\\x94\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyouâ\\x80\\x99re not a deceiving imp you brought no one with youâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cno sir noâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnor givâ\\x80\\x99 no one the office to follow youâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnoâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwellâ\\x80\\x9d said he â\\x80\\x9ci believe you youâ\\x80\\x99d be but a fierce young hound\\nindeed if at your time of life you could help to hunt a wretched\\nwarmint hunted as near death and dunghill as this poor wretched warmint\\nisâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nsomething clicked in his throat as if he had works in him like a clock\\nand was going to strike and he smeared his ragged rough sleeve over\\nhis eyes\\n\\npitying his desolation and watching him as he gradually settled down\\nupon the pie i made bold to say â\\x80\\x9ci am glad you enjoy itâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cdid you speakâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci said i was glad you enjoyed itâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthankee my boy i doâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni had often watched a large dog of ours eating his food and i now\\nnoticed a decided similarity between the dogâ\\x80\\x99s way of eating and the\\nmanâ\\x80\\x99s the man took strong sharp sudden bites just like the dog he\\nswallowed or rather snapped up every mouthful too soon and too fast\\nand he looked sideways here and there while he ate as if he thought\\nthere was danger in every direction of somebodyâ\\x80\\x99s coming to take the\\npie away he was altogether too unsettled in his mind over it to\\nappreciate it comfortably i thought or to have anybody to dine with\\nhim without making a chop with his jaws at the visitor in all of\\nwhich particulars he was very like the dog\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci am afraid you wonâ\\x80\\x99t leave any of it for himâ\\x80\\x9d said i timidly after\\na silence during which i had hesitated as to the politeness of making\\nthe remark â\\x80\\x9cthereâ\\x80\\x99s no more to be got where that came fromâ\\x80\\x9d it was\\nthe certainty of this fact that impelled me to offer the hint\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cleave any for him whoâ\\x80\\x99s himâ\\x80\\x9d said my friend stopping in his\\ncrunching of piecrust\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthe young man that you spoke of that was hid with youâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9coh ahâ\\x80\\x9d he returned with something like a gruff laugh â\\x80\\x9chim yes\\nyes he donâ\\x80\\x99t want no wittlesâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci thought he looked as if he didâ\\x80\\x9d said i\\n\\nthe man stopped eating and regarded me with the keenest scrutiny and\\nthe greatest surprise\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9clooked whenâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cjust nowâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhereâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyonderâ\\x80\\x9d said i pointing â\\x80\\x9cover there where i found him nodding\\nasleep and thought it was youâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nhe held me by the collar and stared at me so that i began to think his\\nfirst idea about cutting my throat had revived\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cdressed like you you know only with a hatâ\\x80\\x9d i explained trembling\\nâ\\x80\\x9candâ\\x80\\x94andâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94i was very anxious to put this delicatelyâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cand withâ\\x80\\x94the same\\nreason for wanting to borrow a file didnâ\\x80\\x99t you hear the cannon last\\nnightâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthen there was firingâ\\x80\\x9d he said to himself\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci wonder you shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t have been sure of thatâ\\x80\\x9d i returned â\\x80\\x9cfor we\\nheard it up at home and thatâ\\x80\\x99s farther away and we were shut in\\nbesidesâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhy see nowâ\\x80\\x9d said he â\\x80\\x9cwhen a manâ\\x80\\x99s alone on these flats with a\\nlight head and a light stomach perishing of cold and want he hears\\nnothinâ\\x80\\x99 all night but guns firing and voices calling hears he sees\\nthe soldiers with their red coats lighted up by the torches carried\\nafore closing in round him hears his number called hears himself\\nchallenged hears the rattle of the muskets hears the orders â\\x80\\x98make\\nready present cover him steady menâ\\x80\\x99 and is laid hands onâ\\x80\\x94and\\nthereâ\\x80\\x99s nothinâ\\x80\\x99 why if i see one pursuing party last nightâ\\x80\\x94coming up\\nin order damn â\\x80\\x99em with their tramp trampâ\\x80\\x94i see a hundred and as to\\nfiring why i see the mist shake with the cannon arter it was broad\\ndayâ\\x80\\x94but this manâ\\x80\\x9d he had said all the rest as if he had forgotten my\\nbeing there â\\x80\\x9cdid you notice anything in himâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9che had a badly bruised faceâ\\x80\\x9d said i recalling what i hardly knew i\\nknew\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnot hereâ\\x80\\x9d exclaimed the man striking his left cheek mercilessly\\nwith the flat of his hand\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyes thereâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhere is heâ\\x80\\x9d he crammed what little food was left into the breast of\\nhis grey jacket â\\x80\\x9cshow me the way he went iâ\\x80\\x99ll pull him down like a\\nbloodhound curse this iron on my sore leg give us hold of the file\\nboyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni indicated in what direction the mist had shrouded the other man and\\nhe looked up at it for an instant but he was down on the rank wet\\ngrass filing at his iron like a madman and not minding me or minding\\nhis own leg which had an old chafe upon it and was bloody but which\\nhe handled as roughly as if it had no more feeling in it than the file\\ni was very much afraid of him again now that he had worked himself\\ninto this fierce hurry and i was likewise very much afraid of keeping\\naway from home any longer i told him i must go but he took no notice\\nso i thought the best thing i could do was to slip off the last i saw\\nof him his head was bent over his knee and he was working hard at his\\nfetter muttering impatient imprecations at it and at his leg the last\\ni heard of him i stopped in the mist to listen and the file was still\\ngoing\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter iv\\n\\n\\ni fully expected to find a constable in the kitchen waiting to take me\\nup but not only was there no constable there but no discovery had yet\\nbeen made of the robbery mrs joe was prodigiously busy in getting the\\nhouse ready for the festivities of the day and joe had been put upon\\nthe kitchen doorstep to keep him out of the dustpanâ\\x80\\x94an article into\\nwhich his destiny always led him sooner or later when my sister was\\nvigorously reaping the floors of her establishment\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cand where the deuce haâ\\x80\\x99 you beenâ\\x80\\x9d was mrs joeâ\\x80\\x99s christmas\\nsalutation when i and my conscience showed ourselves\\n\\ni said i had been down to hear the carols â\\x80\\x9cah wellâ\\x80\\x9d observed mrs\\njoe â\\x80\\x9cyou might haâ\\x80\\x99 done worseâ\\x80\\x9d not a doubt of that i thought\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cperhaps if i warnâ\\x80\\x99t a blacksmithâ\\x80\\x99s wife and whatâ\\x80\\x99s the same thing a\\nslave with her apron never off i should have been to hear the\\ncarolsâ\\x80\\x9d said mrs joe â\\x80\\x9ciâ\\x80\\x99m rather partial to carols myself and\\nthatâ\\x80\\x99s the best of reasons for my never hearing anyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\njoe who had ventured into the kitchen after me as the dustpan had\\nretired before us drew the back of his hand across his nose with a\\nconciliatory air when mrs joe darted a look at him and when her\\neyes were withdrawn secretly crossed his two forefingers and\\nexhibited them to me as our token that mrs joe was in a cross temper\\nthis was so much her normal state that joe and i would often for\\nweeks together be as to our fingers like monumental crusaders as to\\ntheir legs\\n\\nwe were to have a superb dinner consisting of a leg of pickled pork\\nand greens and a pair of roast stuffed fowls a handsome mincepie had\\nbeen made yesterday morning which accounted for the mincemeat not\\nbeing missed and the pudding was already on the boil these extensive\\narrangements occasioned us to be cut off unceremoniously in respect of\\nbreakfast â\\x80\\x9cfor i ainâ\\x80\\x99tâ\\x80\\x9d said mrs joeâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9ci ainâ\\x80\\x99t agoing to have no\\nformal cramming and busting and washing up now with what iâ\\x80\\x99ve got\\nbefore me i promise youâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nso we had our slices served out as if we were two thousand troops on\\na forced march instead of a man and boy at home and we took gulps of\\nmilk and water with apologetic countenances from a jug on the\\ndresser in the meantime mrs joe put clean white curtains up and\\ntacked a new flowered flounce across the wide chimney to replace the\\nold one and uncovered the little state parlour across the passage\\nwhich was never uncovered at any other time but passed the rest of the\\nyear in a cool haze of silver paper which even extended to the four\\nlittle white crockery poodles on the mantelshelf each with a black\\nnose and a basket of flowers in his mouth and each the counterpart of\\nthe other mrs joe was a very clean housekeeper but had an exquisite\\nart of making her cleanliness more uncomfortable and unacceptable than\\ndirt itself cleanliness is next to godliness and some people do the\\nsame by their religion\\n\\nmy sister having so much to do was going to church vicariously that\\nis to say joe and i were going in his workingclothes joe was a\\nwellknit characteristiclooking blacksmith in his holiday clothes he\\nwas more like a scarecrow in good circumstances than anything else\\nnothing that he wore then fitted him or seemed to belong to him and\\neverything that he wore then grazed him on the present festive\\noccasion he emerged from his room when the blithe bells were going\\nthe picture of misery in a full suit of sunday penitentials as to me\\ni think my sister must have had some general idea that i was a young\\noffender whom an accoucheur policeman had taken up on my birthday and\\ndelivered over to her to be dealt with according to the outraged\\nmajesty of the law i was always treated as if i had insisted on being\\nborn in opposition to the dictates of reason religion and morality\\nand against the dissuading arguments of my best friends even when i\\nwas taken to have a new suit of clothes the tailor had orders to make\\nthem like a kind of reformatory and on no account to let me have the\\nfree use of my limbs\\n\\njoe and i going to church therefore must have been a moving spectacle\\nfor compassionate minds yet what i suffered outside was nothing to\\nwhat i underwent within the terrors that had assailed me whenever mrs\\njoe had gone near the pantry or out of the room were only to be\\nequalled by the remorse with which my mind dwelt on what my hands had\\ndone under the weight of my wicked secret i pondered whether the\\nchurch would be powerful enough to shield me from the vengeance of the\\nterrible young man if i divulged to that establishment i conceived\\nthe idea that the time when the banns were read and when the clergyman\\nsaid â\\x80\\x9cye are now to declare itâ\\x80\\x9d would be the time for me to rise and\\npropose a private conference in the vestry i am far from being sure\\nthat i might not have astonished our small congregation by resorting to\\nthis extreme measure but for its being christmas day and no sunday\\n\\nmr wopsle the clerk at church was to dine with us and mr hubble\\nthe wheelwright and mrs hubble and uncle pumblechook joeâ\\x80\\x99s uncle\\nbut mrs joe appropriated him who was a welltodo cornchandler in\\nthe nearest town and drove his own chaisecart the dinner hour was\\nhalfpast one when joe and i got home we found the table laid and\\nmrs joe dressed and the dinner dressing and the front door unlocked\\nit never was at any other time for the company to enter by and\\neverything most splendid and still not a word of the robbery\\n\\nthe time came without bringing with it any relief to my feelings and\\nthe company came mr wopsle united to a roman nose and a large\\nshining bald forehead had a deep voice which he was uncommonly proud\\nof indeed it was understood among his acquaintance that if you could\\nonly give him his head he would read the clergyman into fits he\\nhimself confessed that if the church was â\\x80\\x9cthrown openâ\\x80\\x9d meaning to\\ncompetition he would not despair of making his mark in it the church\\nnot being â\\x80\\x9cthrown openâ\\x80\\x9d he was as i have said our clerk but he\\npunished the amens tremendously and when he gave out the psalmâ\\x80\\x94always\\ngiving the whole verseâ\\x80\\x94he looked all round the congregation first as\\nmuch as to say â\\x80\\x9cyou have heard my friend overhead oblige me with your\\nopinion of this styleâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni opened the door to the companyâ\\x80\\x94making believe that it was a habit of\\nours to open that doorâ\\x80\\x94and i opened it first to mr wopsle next to\\nmr and mrs hubble and last of all to uncle pumblechook nb i was\\nnot allowed to call him uncle under the severest penalties\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmrs joeâ\\x80\\x9d said uncle pumblechook a large hardbreathing middleaged\\nslow man with a mouth like a fish dull staring eyes and sandy hair\\nstanding upright on his head so that he looked as if he had just been\\nall but choked and had that moment come to â\\x80\\x9ci have brought you as the\\ncompliments of the seasonâ\\x80\\x94i have brought you mum a bottle of sherry\\nwineâ\\x80\\x94and i have brought you mum a bottle of port wineâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nevery christmas day he presented himself as a profound novelty with\\nexactly the same words and carrying the two bottles like dumbbells\\nevery christmas day mrs joe replied as she now replied â\\x80\\x9co unâ\\x80\\x94cle\\npumbleâ\\x80\\x94chook this is kindâ\\x80\\x9d every christmas day he retorted as he\\nnow retorted â\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s no more than your merits and now are you all\\nbobbish and howâ\\x80\\x99s sixpennorth of halfpenceâ\\x80\\x9d meaning me\\n\\nwe dined on these occasions in the kitchen and adjourned for the nuts\\nand oranges and apples to the parlour which was a change very like\\njoeâ\\x80\\x99s change from his workingclothes to his sunday dress my sister\\nwas uncommonly lively on the present occasion and indeed was generally\\nmore gracious in the society of mrs hubble than in other company i\\nremember mrs hubble as a little curly sharpedged person in skyblue\\nwho held a conventionally juvenile position because she had married\\nmr hubbleâ\\x80\\x94i donâ\\x80\\x99t know at what remote periodâ\\x80\\x94when she was much\\nyounger than he i remember mr hubble as a tough highshouldered\\nstooping old man of a sawdusty fragrance with his legs\\nextraordinarily wide apart so that in my short days i always saw some\\nmiles of open country between them when i met him coming up the lane\\n\\namong this good company i should have felt myself even if i hadnâ\\x80\\x99t\\nrobbed the pantry in a false position not because i was squeezed in\\nat an acute angle of the tablecloth with the table in my chest and\\nthe pumblechookian elbow in my eye nor because i was not allowed to\\nspeak i didnâ\\x80\\x99t want to speak nor because i was regaled with the\\nscaly tips of the drumsticks of the fowls and with those obscure\\ncorners of pork of which the pig when living had had the least reason\\nto be vain no i should not have minded that if they would only have\\nleft me alone but they wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t leave me alone they seemed to think\\nthe opportunity lost if they failed to point the conversation at me\\nevery now and then and stick the point into me i might have been an\\nunfortunate little bull in a spanish arena i got so smartingly touched\\nup by these moral goads\\n\\nit began the moment we sat down to dinner mr wopsle said grace with\\ntheatrical declamationâ\\x80\\x94as it now appears to me something like a\\nreligious cross of the ghost in hamlet with richard the thirdâ\\x80\\x94and\\nended with the very proper aspiration that we might be truly grateful\\nupon which my sister fixed me with her eye and said in a low\\nreproachful voice â\\x80\\x9cdo you hear that be gratefulâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cespeciallyâ\\x80\\x9d said mr pumblechook â\\x80\\x9cbe grateful boy to them which\\nbrought you up by handâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nmrs hubble shook her head and contemplating me with a mournful\\npresentiment that i should come to no good asked â\\x80\\x9cwhy is it that the\\nyoung are never gratefulâ\\x80\\x9d this moral mystery seemed too much for the\\ncompany until mr hubble tersely solved it by saying â\\x80\\x9cnaterally\\nwiciousâ\\x80\\x9d everybody then murmured â\\x80\\x9ctrueâ\\x80\\x9d and looked at me in a\\nparticularly unpleasant and personal manner\\n\\njoeâ\\x80\\x99s station and influence were something feebler if possible when\\nthere was company than when there was none but he always aided and\\ncomforted me when he could in some way of his own and he always did\\nso at dinnertime by giving me gravy if there were any there being\\nplenty of gravy today joe spooned into my plate at this point about\\nhalf a pint\\n\\na little later on in the dinner mr wopsle reviewed the sermon with\\nsome severity and intimatedâ\\x80\\x94in the usual hypothetical case of the\\nchurch being â\\x80\\x9cthrown openâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94what kind of sermon he would have given\\nthem after favouring them with some heads of that discourse he\\nremarked that he considered the subject of the dayâ\\x80\\x99s homily ill\\nchosen which was the less excusable he added when there were so many\\nsubjects â\\x80\\x9cgoing aboutâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ctrue againâ\\x80\\x9d said uncle pumblechook â\\x80\\x9cyouâ\\x80\\x99ve hit it sir plenty of\\nsubjects going about for them that know how to put salt upon their\\ntails thatâ\\x80\\x99s whatâ\\x80\\x99s wanted a man neednâ\\x80\\x99t go far to find a subject if\\nheâ\\x80\\x99s ready with his saltboxâ\\x80\\x9d mr pumblechook added after a short\\ninterval of reflection â\\x80\\x9clook at pork alone thereâ\\x80\\x99s a subject if you\\nwant a subject look at porkâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ctrue sir many a moral for the youngâ\\x80\\x9d returned mr wopsleâ\\x80\\x94and i\\nknew he was going to lug me in before he said it â\\x80\\x9cmight be deduced\\nfrom that textâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou listen to thisâ\\x80\\x9d said my sister to me in a severe parenthesis\\n\\njoe gave me some more gravy\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cswineâ\\x80\\x9d pursued mr wopsle in his deepest voice and pointing his\\nfork at my blushes as if he were mentioning my christian nameâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cswine\\nwere the companions of the prodigal the gluttony of swine is put\\nbefore us as an example to the youngâ\\x80\\x9d i thought this pretty well in\\nhim who had been praising up the pork for being so plump and juicy\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhat is detestable in a pig is more detestable in a boyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cor girlâ\\x80\\x9d suggested mr hubble\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cof course or girl mr hubbleâ\\x80\\x9d assented mr wopsle rather\\nirritably â\\x80\\x9cbut there is no girl presentâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbesidesâ\\x80\\x9d said mr pumblechook turning sharp on me â\\x80\\x9cthink what\\nyouâ\\x80\\x99ve got to be grateful for if youâ\\x80\\x99d been born a squeakerâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9che was if ever a child wasâ\\x80\\x9d said my sister most emphatically\\n\\njoe gave me some more gravy\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwell but i mean a fourfooted squeakerâ\\x80\\x9d said mr pumblechook â\\x80\\x9cif\\nyou had been born such would you have been here now not youâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cunless in that formâ\\x80\\x9d said mr wopsle nodding towards the dish\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbut i donâ\\x80\\x99t mean in that form sirâ\\x80\\x9d returned mr pumblechook who had\\nan objection to being interrupted â\\x80\\x9ci mean enjoying himself with his\\nelders and betters and improving himself with their conversation and\\nrolling in the lap of luxury would he have been doing that no he\\nwouldnâ\\x80\\x99t and what would have been your destinationâ\\x80\\x9d turning on me\\nagain â\\x80\\x9cyou would have been disposed of for so many shillings according\\nto the market price of the article and dunstable the butcher would\\nhave come up to you as you lay in your straw and he would have whipped\\nyou under his left arm and with his right he would have tucked up his\\nfrock to get a penknife from out of his waistcoatpocket and he would\\nhave shed your blood and had your life no bringing up by hand then\\nnot a bit of itâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\njoe offered me more gravy which i was afraid to take\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9che was a world of trouble to you maâ\\x80\\x99amâ\\x80\\x9d said mrs hubble\\ncommiserating my sister\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ctroubleâ\\x80\\x9d echoed my sister â\\x80\\x9ctroubleâ\\x80\\x9d and then entered on a fearful\\ncatalogue of all the illnesses i had been guilty of and all the acts\\nof sleeplessness i had committed and all the high places i had tumbled\\nfrom and all the low places i had tumbled into and all the injuries i\\nhad done myself and all the times she had wished me in my grave and i\\nhad contumaciously refused to go there\\n\\ni think the romans must have aggravated one another very much with\\ntheir noses perhaps they became the restless people they were in\\nconsequence anyhow mr wopsleâ\\x80\\x99s roman nose so aggravated me during\\nthe recital of my misdemeanours that i should have liked to pull it\\nuntil he howled but all i had endured up to this time was nothing in\\ncomparison with the awful feelings that took possession of me when the\\npause was broken which ensued upon my sisterâ\\x80\\x99s recital and in which\\npause everybody had looked at me as i felt painfully conscious with\\nindignation and abhorrence\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyetâ\\x80\\x9d said mr pumblechook leading the company gently back to the\\ntheme from which they had strayed â\\x80\\x9cporkâ\\x80\\x94regarded as biledâ\\x80\\x94is rich\\ntoo ainâ\\x80\\x99t itâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9chave a little brandy uncleâ\\x80\\x9d said my sister\\n\\no heavens it had come at last he would find it was weak he would say\\nit was weak and i was lost i held tight to the leg of the table under\\nthe cloth with both hands and awaited my fate\\n\\nmy sister went for the stone bottle came back with the stone bottle\\nand poured his brandy out no one else taking any the wretched man\\ntrifled with his glassâ\\x80\\x94took it up looked at it through the light put\\nit downâ\\x80\\x94prolonged my misery all this time mrs joe and joe were\\nbriskly clearing the table for the pie and pudding\\n\\ni couldnâ\\x80\\x99t keep my eyes off him always holding tight by the leg of the\\ntable with my hands and feet i saw the miserable creature finger his\\nglass playfully take it up smile throw his head back and drink the\\nbrandy off instantly afterwards the company were seized with\\nunspeakable consternation owing to his springing to his feet turning\\nround several times in an appalling spasmodic whoopingcough dance and\\nrushing out at the door he then became visible through the window\\nviolently plunging and expectorating making the most hideous faces\\nand apparently out of his mind\\n\\ni held on tight while mrs joe and joe ran to him i didnâ\\x80\\x99t know how i\\nhad done it but i had no doubt i had murdered him somehow in my\\ndreadful situation it was a relief when he was brought back and\\nsurveying the company all round as if they had disagreed with him\\nsank down into his chair with the one significant gasp â\\x80\\x9ctarâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni had filled up the bottle from the tarwater jug i knew he would be\\nworse by and by i moved the table like a medium of the present day\\nby the vigor of my unseen hold upon it\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ctarâ\\x80\\x9d cried my sister in amazement â\\x80\\x9cwhy how ever could tar come\\nthereâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nbut uncle pumblechook who was omnipotent in that kitchen wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t\\nhear the word wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t hear of the subject imperiously waved it all\\naway with his hand and asked for hot gin and water my sister who had\\nbegun to be alarmingly meditative had to employ herself actively in\\ngetting the gin the hot water the sugar and the lemonpeel and\\nmixing them for the time being at least i was saved i still held on\\nto the leg of the table but clutched it now with the fervor of\\ngratitude\\n\\nby degrees i became calm enough to release my grasp and partake of\\npudding mr pumblechook partook of pudding all partook of pudding\\nthe course terminated and mr pumblechook had begun to beam under the\\ngenial influence of gin and water i began to think i should get over\\nthe day when my sister said to joe â\\x80\\x9cclean platesâ\\x80\\x94coldâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni clutched the leg of the table again immediately and pressed it to my\\nbosom as if it had been the companion of my youth and friend of my\\nsoul i foresaw what was coming and i felt that this time i really was\\ngone\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou must tasteâ\\x80\\x9d said my sister addressing the guests with her best\\ngraceâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cyou must taste to finish with such a delightful and delicious\\npresent of uncle pumblechookâ\\x80\\x99sâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nmust they let them not hope to taste it\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou must knowâ\\x80\\x9d said my sister rising â\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s a pie a savory pork\\npieâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthe company murmured their compliments uncle pumblechook sensible of\\nhaving deserved well of his fellowcreatures saidâ\\x80\\x94quite vivaciously\\nall things consideredâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cwell mrs joe weâ\\x80\\x99ll do our best endeavours\\nlet us have a cut at this same pieâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nmy sister went out to get it i heard her steps proceed to the pantry\\ni saw mr pumblechook balance his knife i saw reawakening appetite in\\nthe roman nostrils of mr wopsle i heard mr hubble remark that â\\x80\\x9ca bit\\nof savory pork pie would lay atop of anything you could mention and do\\nno harmâ\\x80\\x9d and i heard joe say â\\x80\\x9cyou shall have some pipâ\\x80\\x9d i have never\\nbeen absolutely certain whether i uttered a shrill yell of terror\\nmerely in spirit or in the bodily hearing of the company i felt that\\ni could bear no more and that i must run away i released the leg of\\nthe table and ran for my life\\n\\nbut i ran no farther than the house door for there i ran headforemost\\ninto a party of soldiers with their muskets one of whom held out a\\npair of handcuffs to me saying â\\x80\\x9chere you are look sharp come onâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter v\\n\\n\\nthe apparition of a file of soldiers ringing down the butends of their\\nloaded muskets on our doorstep caused the dinnerparty to rise from\\ntable in confusion and caused mrs joe reentering the kitchen\\nemptyhanded to stop short and stare in her wondering lament of\\nâ\\x80\\x9cgracious goodness gracious me whatâ\\x80\\x99s goneâ\\x80\\x94with theâ\\x80\\x94pieâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthe sergeant and i were in the kitchen when mrs joe stood staring at\\nwhich crisis i partially recovered the use of my senses it was the\\nsergeant who had spoken to me and he was now looking round at the\\ncompany with his handcuffs invitingly extended towards them in his\\nright hand and his left on my shoulder\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cexcuse me ladies and gentlemanâ\\x80\\x9d said the sergeant â\\x80\\x9cbut as i have\\nmentioned at the door to this smart young shaverâ\\x80\\x9d which he hadnâ\\x80\\x99t\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci am on a chase in the name of the king and i want the blacksmithâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cand pray what might you want with himâ\\x80\\x9d retorted my sister quick to\\nresent his being wanted at all\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmissisâ\\x80\\x9d returned the gallant sergeant â\\x80\\x9cspeaking for myself i should\\nreply the honour and pleasure of his fine wifeâ\\x80\\x99s acquaintance\\nspeaking for the king i answer a little job doneâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthis was received as rather neat in the sergeant insomuch that mr\\npumblechook cried audibly â\\x80\\x9cgood againâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou see blacksmithâ\\x80\\x9d said the sergeant who had by this time picked\\nout joe with his eye â\\x80\\x9cwe have had an accident with these and i find\\nthe lock of one of â\\x80\\x99em goes wrong and the coupling donâ\\x80\\x99t act pretty\\nas they are wanted for immediate service will you throw your eye over\\nthemâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\njoe threw his eye over them and pronounced that the job would\\nnecessitate the lighting of his forge fire and would take nearer two\\nhours than one â\\x80\\x9cwill it then will you set about it at once\\nblacksmithâ\\x80\\x9d said the offhand sergeant â\\x80\\x9cas itâ\\x80\\x99s on his majestyâ\\x80\\x99s\\nservice and if my men can bear a hand anywhere theyâ\\x80\\x99ll make\\nthemselves usefulâ\\x80\\x9d with that he called to his men who came trooping\\ninto the kitchen one after another and piled their arms in a corner\\nand then they stood about as soldiers do now with their hands\\nloosely clasped before them now resting a knee or a shoulder now\\neasing a belt or a pouch now opening the door to spit stiffly over\\ntheir high stocks out into the yard\\n\\nall these things i saw without then knowing that i saw them for i was\\nin an agony of apprehension but beginning to perceive that the\\nhandcuffs were not for me and that the military had so far got the\\nbetter of the pie as to put it in the background i collected a little\\nmore of my scattered wits\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwould you give me the timeâ\\x80\\x9d said the sergeant addressing himself to\\nmr pumblechook as to a man whose appreciative powers justified the\\ninference that he was equal to the time\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s just gone half past twoâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthatâ\\x80\\x99s not so badâ\\x80\\x9d said the sergeant reflecting â\\x80\\x9ceven if i was\\nforced to halt here nigh two hours thatâ\\x80\\x99ll do how far might you call\\nyourselves from the marshes hereabouts not above a mile i reckonâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cjust a mileâ\\x80\\x9d said mrs joe\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthatâ\\x80\\x99ll do we begin to close in upon â\\x80\\x99em about dusk a little before\\ndusk my orders are thatâ\\x80\\x99ll doâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cconvicts sergeantâ\\x80\\x9d asked mr wopsle in a matterofcourse way\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cayâ\\x80\\x9d returned the sergeant â\\x80\\x9ctwo theyâ\\x80\\x99re pretty well known to be out\\non the marshes still and they wonâ\\x80\\x99t try to get clear of â\\x80\\x99em before\\ndusk anybody here seen anything of any such gameâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\neverybody myself excepted said no with confidence nobody thought of\\nme\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwellâ\\x80\\x9d said the sergeant â\\x80\\x9ctheyâ\\x80\\x99ll find themselves trapped in a\\ncircle i expect sooner than they count on now blacksmith if youâ\\x80\\x99re\\nready his majesty the king isâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\njoe had got his coat and waistcoat and cravat off and his leather\\napron on and passed into the forge one of the soldiers opened its\\nwooden windows another lighted the fire another turned to at the\\nbellows the rest stood round the blaze which was soon roaring then\\njoe began to hammer and clink hammer and clink and we all looked on\\n\\nthe interest of the impending pursuit not only absorbed the general\\nattention but even made my sister liberal she drew a pitcher of beer\\nfrom the cask for the soldiers and invited the sergeant to take a\\nglass of brandy but mr pumblechook said sharply â\\x80\\x9cgive him wine\\nmum iâ\\x80\\x99ll engage thereâ\\x80\\x99s no tar in thatâ\\x80\\x9d so the sergeant thanked him\\nand said that as he preferred his drink without tar he would take\\nwine if it was equally convenient when it was given him he drank his\\nmajestyâ\\x80\\x99s health and compliments of the season and took it all at a\\nmouthful and smacked his lips\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cgood stuff eh sergeantâ\\x80\\x9d said mr pumblechook\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ciâ\\x80\\x99ll tell you somethingâ\\x80\\x9d returned the sergeant â\\x80\\x9ci suspect that\\nstuffâ\\x80\\x99s of your providingâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nmr pumblechook with a fat sort of laugh said â\\x80\\x9cay ay whyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbecauseâ\\x80\\x9d returned the sergeant clapping him on the shoulder â\\x80\\x9cyouâ\\x80\\x99re\\na man that knows whatâ\\x80\\x99s whatâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cdâ\\x80\\x99ye think soâ\\x80\\x9d said mr pumblechook with his former laugh â\\x80\\x9chave\\nanother glassâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwith you hob and nobâ\\x80\\x9d returned the sergeant â\\x80\\x9cthe top of mine to the\\nfoot of yoursâ\\x80\\x94the foot of yours to the top of mineâ\\x80\\x94ring once ring\\ntwiceâ\\x80\\x94the best tune on the musical glasses your health may you live\\na thousand years and never be a worse judge of the right sort than you\\nare at the present moment of your lifeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthe sergeant tossed off his glass again and seemed quite ready for\\nanother glass i noticed that mr pumblechook in his hospitality\\nappeared to forget that he had made a present of the wine but took the\\nbottle from mrs joe and had all the credit of handing it about in a\\ngush of joviality even i got some and he was so very free of the wine\\nthat he even called for the other bottle and handed that about with\\nthe same liberality when the first was gone\\n\\nas i watched them while they all stood clustering about the forge\\nenjoying themselves so much i thought what terrible good sauce for a\\ndinner my fugitive friend on the marshes was they had not enjoyed\\nthemselves a quarter so much before the entertainment was brightened\\nwith the excitement he furnished and now when they were all in lively\\nanticipation of â\\x80\\x9cthe two villainsâ\\x80\\x9d being taken and when the bellows\\nseemed to roar for the fugitives the fire to flare for them the smoke\\nto hurry away in pursuit of them joe to hammer and clink for them and\\nall the murky shadows on the wall to shake at them in menace as the\\nblaze rose and sank and the redhot sparks dropped and died the pale\\nafternoon outside almost seemed in my pitying young fancy to have\\nturned pale on their account poor wretches\\n\\nat last joeâ\\x80\\x99s job was done and the ringing and roaring stopped as\\njoe got on his coat he mustered courage to propose that some of us\\nshould go down with the soldiers and see what came of the hunt mr\\npumblechook and mr hubble declined on the plea of a pipe and ladiesâ\\x80\\x99\\nsociety but mr wopsle said he would go if joe would joe said he was\\nagreeable and would take me if mrs joe approved we never should\\nhave got leave to go i am sure but for mrs joeâ\\x80\\x99s curiosity to know\\nall about it and how it ended as it was she merely stipulated â\\x80\\x9cif\\nyou bring the boy back with his head blown to bits by a musket donâ\\x80\\x99t\\nlook to me to put it together againâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthe sergeant took a polite leave of the ladies and parted from mr\\npumblechook as from a comrade though i doubt if he were quite as fully\\nsensible of that gentlemanâ\\x80\\x99s merits under arid conditions as when\\nsomething moist was going his men resumed their muskets and fell in\\nmr wopsle joe and i received strict charge to keep in the rear and\\nto speak no word after we reached the marshes when we were all out in\\nthe raw air and were steadily moving towards our business i\\ntreasonably whispered to joe â\\x80\\x9ci hope joe we shanâ\\x80\\x99t find themâ\\x80\\x9d and\\njoe whispered to me â\\x80\\x9ciâ\\x80\\x99d give a shilling if they had cut and run\\npipâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nwe were joined by no stragglers from the village for the weather was\\ncold and threatening the way dreary the footing bad darkness coming\\non and the people had good fires indoors and were keeping the day a\\nfew faces hurried to glowing windows and looked after us but none came\\nout we passed the fingerpost and held straight on to the churchyard\\nthere we were stopped a few minutes by a signal from the sergeantâ\\x80\\x99s\\nhand while two or three of his men dispersed themselves among the\\ngraves and also examined the porch they came in again without finding\\nanything and then we struck out on the open marshes through the gate\\nat the side of the churchyard a bitter sleet came rattling against us\\nhere on the east wind and joe took me on his back\\n\\nnow that we were out upon the dismal wilderness where they little\\nthought i had been within eight or nine hours and had seen both men\\nhiding i considered for the first time with great dread if we should\\ncome upon them would my particular convict suppose that it was i who\\nhad brought the soldiers there he had asked me if i was a deceiving\\nimp and he had said i should be a fierce young hound if i joined the\\nhunt against him would he believe that i was both imp and hound in\\ntreacherous earnest and had betrayed him\\n\\nit was of no use asking myself this question now there i was on joeâ\\x80\\x99s\\nback and there was joe beneath me charging at the ditches like a\\nhunter and stimulating mr wopsle not to tumble on his roman nose and\\nto keep up with us the soldiers were in front of us extending into a\\npretty wide line with an interval between man and man we were taking\\nthe course i had begun with and from which i had diverged in the mist\\neither the mist was not out again yet or the wind had dispelled it\\nunder the low red glare of sunset the beacon and the gibbet and the\\nmound of the battery and the opposite shore of the river were plain\\nthough all of a watery lead colour\\n\\nwith my heart thumping like a blacksmith at joeâ\\x80\\x99s broad shoulder i\\nlooked all about for any sign of the convicts i could see none i\\ncould hear none mr wopsle had greatly alarmed me more than once by\\nhis blowing and hard breathing but i knew the sounds by this time and\\ncould dissociate them from the object of pursuit i got a dreadful\\nstart when i thought i heard the file still going but it was only a\\nsheepbell the sheep stopped in their eating and looked timidly at us\\nand the cattle their heads turned from the wind and sleet stared\\nangrily as if they held us responsible for both annoyances but except\\nthese things and the shudder of the dying day in every blade of grass\\nthere was no break in the bleak stillness of the marshes\\n\\nthe soldiers were moving on in the direction of the old battery and we\\nwere moving on a little way behind them when all of a sudden we all\\nstopped for there had reached us on the wings of the wind and rain a\\nlong shout it was repeated it was at a distance towards the east but\\nit was long and loud nay there seemed to be two or more shouts raised\\ntogetherâ\\x80\\x94if one might judge from a confusion in the sound\\n\\nto this effect the sergeant and the nearest men were speaking under\\ntheir breath when joe and i came up after another momentâ\\x80\\x99s listening\\njoe who was a good judge agreed and mr wopsle who was a bad judge\\nagreed the sergeant a decisive man ordered that the sound should not\\nbe answered but that the course should be changed and that his men\\nshould make towards it â\\x80\\x9cat the doubleâ\\x80\\x9d so we slanted to the right\\nwhere the east was and joe pounded away so wonderfully that i had\\nto hold on tight to keep my seat\\n\\nit was a run indeed now and what joe called in the only two words he\\nspoke all the time â\\x80\\x9ca winderâ\\x80\\x9d down banks and up banks and over\\ngates and splashing into dikes and breaking among coarse rushes no\\nman cared where he went as we came nearer to the shouting it became\\nmore and more apparent that it was made by more than one voice\\nsometimes it seemed to stop altogether and then the soldiers stopped\\nwhen it broke out again the soldiers made for it at a greater rate\\nthan ever and we after them after a while we had so run it down\\nthat we could hear one voice calling â\\x80\\x9cmurderâ\\x80\\x9d and another voice\\nâ\\x80\\x9cconvicts runaways guard this way for the runaway convictsâ\\x80\\x9d then\\nboth voices would seem to be stifled in a struggle and then would\\nbreak out again and when it had come to this the soldiers ran like\\ndeer and joe too\\n\\nthe sergeant ran in first when we had run the noise quite down and\\ntwo of his men ran in close upon him their pieces were cocked and\\nlevelled when we all ran in\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9chere are both menâ\\x80\\x9d panted the sergeant struggling at the bottom of a\\nditch â\\x80\\x9csurrender you two and confound you for two wild beasts come\\nasunderâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nwater was splashing and mud was flying and oaths were being sworn\\nand blows were being struck when some more men went down into the\\nditch to help the sergeant and dragged out separately my convict and\\nthe other one both were bleeding and panting and execrating and\\nstruggling but of course i knew them both directly\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmindâ\\x80\\x9d said my convict wiping blood from his face with his ragged\\nsleeves and shaking torn hair from his fingers â\\x80\\x9ci took him i\\ngive him up to you mind thatâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s not much to be particular aboutâ\\x80\\x9d said the sergeant â\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99ll do\\nyou small good my man being in the same plight yourself handcuffs\\nthereâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci donâ\\x80\\x99t expect it to do me any good i donâ\\x80\\x99t want it to do me more\\ngood than it does nowâ\\x80\\x9d said my convict with a greedy laugh â\\x80\\x9ci took\\nhim he knows it thatâ\\x80\\x99s enough for meâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthe other convict was livid to look at and in addition to the old\\nbruised left side of his face seemed to be bruised and torn all over\\nhe could not so much as get his breath to speak until they were both\\nseparately handcuffed but leaned upon a soldier to keep himself from\\nfalling\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ctake notice guardâ\\x80\\x94he tried to murder meâ\\x80\\x9d were his first words\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ctried to murder himâ\\x80\\x9d said my convict disdainfully â\\x80\\x9ctry and not do\\nit i took him and givâ\\x80\\x99 him up thatâ\\x80\\x99s what i done i not only\\nprevented him getting off the marshes but i dragged him hereâ\\x80\\x94dragged\\nhim this far on his way back heâ\\x80\\x99s a gentleman if you please this\\nvillain now the hulks has got its gentleman again through me murder\\nhim worth my while too to murder him when i could do worse and drag\\nhim backâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthe other one still gasped â\\x80\\x9che triedâ\\x80\\x94he triedtoâ\\x80\\x94murder me bearâ\\x80\\x94bear\\nwitnessâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9clookee hereâ\\x80\\x9d said my convict to the sergeant â\\x80\\x9csinglehanded i got\\nclear of the prisonship i made a dash and i done it i could haâ\\x80\\x99 got\\nclear of these deathcold flats likewiseâ\\x80\\x94look at my leg you wonâ\\x80\\x99t find\\nmuch iron on itâ\\x80\\x94if i hadnâ\\x80\\x99t made the discovery that he was here let\\nhim go free let him profit by the means as i found out let him\\nmake a tool of me afresh and again once more no no no if i had\\ndied at the bottom thereâ\\x80\\x9d and he made an emphatic swing at the ditch\\nwith his manacled hands â\\x80\\x9ciâ\\x80\\x99d have held to him with that grip that you\\nshould have been safe to find him in my holdâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthe other fugitive who was evidently in extreme horror of his\\ncompanion repeated â\\x80\\x9che tried to murder me i should have been a dead\\nman if you had not come upâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9che liesâ\\x80\\x9d said my convict with fierce energy â\\x80\\x9cheâ\\x80\\x99s a liar born and\\nheâ\\x80\\x99ll die a liar look at his face ainâ\\x80\\x99t it written there let him\\nturn those eyes of his on me i defy him to do itâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthe other with an effort at a scornful smile which could not\\nhowever collect the nervous working of his mouth into any set\\nexpression looked at the soldiers and looked about at the marshes and\\nat the sky but certainly did not look at the speaker\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cdo you see himâ\\x80\\x9d pursued my convict â\\x80\\x9cdo you see what a villain he is\\ndo you see those grovelling and wandering eyes thatâ\\x80\\x99s how he looked\\nwhen we were tried together he never looked at meâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthe other always working and working his dry lips and turning his eyes\\nrestlessly about him far and near did at last turn them for a moment\\non the speaker with the words â\\x80\\x9cyou are not much to look atâ\\x80\\x9d and with\\na halftaunting glance at the bound hands at that point my convict\\nbecame so frantically exasperated that he would have rushed upon him\\nbut for the interposition of the soldiers â\\x80\\x9cdidnâ\\x80\\x99t i tell youâ\\x80\\x9d said\\nthe other convict then â\\x80\\x9cthat he would murder me if he couldâ\\x80\\x9d and any\\none could see that he shook with fear and that there broke out upon\\nhis lips curious white flakes like thin snow\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cenough of this parleyâ\\x80\\x9d said the sergeant â\\x80\\x9clight those torchesâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nas one of the soldiers who carried a basket in lieu of a gun went\\ndown on his knee to open it my convict looked round him for the first\\ntime and saw me i had alighted from joeâ\\x80\\x99s back on the brink of the\\nditch when we came up and had not moved since i looked at him eagerly\\nwhen he looked at me and slightly moved my hands and shook my head i\\nhad been waiting for him to see me that i might try to assure him of my\\ninnocence it was not at all expressed to me that he even comprehended\\nmy intention for he gave me a look that i did not understand and it\\nall passed in a moment but if he had looked at me for an hour or for a\\nday i could not have remembered his face ever afterwards as having\\nbeen more attentive\\n\\nthe soldier with the basket soon got a light and lighted three or four\\ntorches and took one himself and distributed the others it had been\\nalmost dark before but now it seemed quite dark and soon afterwards\\nvery dark before we departed from that spot four soldiers standing in\\na ring fired twice into the air presently we saw other torches\\nkindled at some distance behind us and others on the marshes on the\\nopposite bank of the river â\\x80\\x9call rightâ\\x80\\x9d said the sergeant â\\x80\\x9cmarchâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nwe had not gone far when three cannon were fired ahead of us with a\\nsound that seemed to burst something inside my ear â\\x80\\x9cyou are expected\\non boardâ\\x80\\x9d said the sergeant to my convict â\\x80\\x9cthey know you are coming\\ndonâ\\x80\\x99t straggle my man close up hereâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthe two were kept apart and each walked surrounded by a separate\\nguard i had hold of joeâ\\x80\\x99s hand now and joe carried one of the\\ntorches mr wopsle had been for going back but joe was resolved to\\nsee it out so we went on with the party there was a reasonably good\\npath now mostly on the edge of the river with a divergence here and\\nthere where a dike came with a miniature windmill on it and a muddy\\nsluicegate when i looked round i could see the other lights coming\\nin after us the torches we carried dropped great blotches of fire upon\\nthe track and i could see those too lying smoking and flaring i\\ncould see nothing else but black darkness our lights warmed the air\\nabout us with their pitchy blaze and the two prisoners seemed rather\\nto like that as they limped along in the midst of the muskets we\\ncould not go fast because of their lameness and they were so spent\\nthat two or three times we had to halt while they rested\\n\\nafter an hour or so of this travelling we came to a rough wooden hut\\nand a landingplace there was a guard in the hut and they challenged\\nand the sergeant answered then we went into the hut where there was\\na smell of tobacco and whitewash and a bright fire and a lamp and a\\nstand of muskets and a drum and a low wooden bedstead like an\\novergrown mangle without the machinery capable of holding about a\\ndozen soldiers all at once three or four soldiers who lay upon it in\\ntheir greatcoats were not much interested in us but just lifted their\\nheads and took a sleepy stare and then lay down again the sergeant\\nmade some kind of report and some entry in a book and then the\\nconvict whom i call the other convict was drafted off with his guard\\nto go on board first\\n\\nmy convict never looked at me except that once while we stood in the\\nhut he stood before the fire looking thoughtfully at it or putting up\\nhis feet by turns upon the hob and looking thoughtfully at them as if\\nhe pitied them for their recent adventures suddenly he turned to the\\nsergeant and remarkedâ\\x80\\x94\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci wish to say something respecting this escape it may prevent some\\npersons laying under suspicion alonger meâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou can say what you likeâ\\x80\\x9d returned the sergeant standing coolly\\nlooking at him with his arms folded â\\x80\\x9cbut you have no call to say it\\nhere youâ\\x80\\x99ll have opportunity enough to say about it and hear about\\nit before itâ\\x80\\x99s done with you knowâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci know but this is another pint a separate matter a man canâ\\x80\\x99t\\nstarve at least i canâ\\x80\\x99t i took some wittles up at the willage over\\nyonderâ\\x80\\x94where the church stands aâ\\x80\\x99most out on the marshesâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou mean stoleâ\\x80\\x9d said the sergeant\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cand iâ\\x80\\x99ll tell you where from from the blacksmithâ\\x80\\x99sâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9challoaâ\\x80\\x9d said the sergeant staring at joe\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9challoa pipâ\\x80\\x9d said joe staring at me\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cit was some broken wittlesâ\\x80\\x94thatâ\\x80\\x99s what it wasâ\\x80\\x94and a dram of liquor\\nand a pieâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9chave you happened to miss such an article as a pie blacksmithâ\\x80\\x9d asked\\nthe sergeant confidentially\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmy wife did at the very moment when you came in donâ\\x80\\x99t you know\\npipâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9csoâ\\x80\\x9d said my convict turning his eyes on joe in a moody manner and\\nwithout the least glance at meâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cso youâ\\x80\\x99re the blacksmith are you\\nthan iâ\\x80\\x99m sorry to say iâ\\x80\\x99ve eat your pieâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cgod knows youâ\\x80\\x99re welcome to itâ\\x80\\x94so far as it was ever mineâ\\x80\\x9d returned\\njoe with a saving remembrance of mrs joe â\\x80\\x9cwe donâ\\x80\\x99t know what you\\nhave done but we wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t have you starved to death for it poor\\nmiserable fellowcreaturâ\\x80\\x94would us pipâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthe something that i had noticed before clicked in the manâ\\x80\\x99s throat\\nagain and he turned his back the boat had returned and his guard\\nwere ready so we followed him to the landingplace made of rough\\nstakes and stones and saw him put into the boat which was rowed by a\\ncrew of convicts like himself no one seemed surprised to see him or\\ninterested in seeing him or glad to see him or sorry to see him or\\nspoke a word except that somebody in the boat growled as if to dogs\\nâ\\x80\\x9cgive way youâ\\x80\\x9d which was the signal for the dip of the oars by the\\nlight of the torches we saw the black hulk lying out a little way from\\nthe mud of the shore like a wicked noahâ\\x80\\x99s ark cribbed and barred and\\nmoored by massive rusty chains the prisonship seemed in my young eyes\\nto be ironed like the prisoners we saw the boat go alongside and we\\nsaw him taken up the side and disappear then the ends of the torches\\nwere flung hissing into the water and went out as if it were all over\\nwith him\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter vi\\n\\n\\nmy state of mind regarding the pilfering from which i had been so\\nunexpectedly exonerated did not impel me to frank disclosure but i\\nhope it had some dregs of good at the bottom of it\\n\\ni do not recall that i felt any tenderness of conscience in reference\\nto mrs joe when the fear of being found out was lifted off me but i\\nloved joeâ\\x80\\x94perhaps for no better reason in those early days than\\nbecause the dear fellow let me love himâ\\x80\\x94and as to him my inner self\\nwas not so easily composed it was much upon my mind particularly when\\ni first saw him looking about for his file that i ought to tell joe\\nthe whole truth yet i did not and for the reason that i mistrusted\\nthat if i did he would think me worse than i was the fear of losing\\njoeâ\\x80\\x99s confidence and of thenceforth sitting in the chimney corner at\\nnight staring drearily at my forever lost companion and friend tied up\\nmy tongue i morbidly represented to myself that if joe knew it i\\nnever afterwards could see him at the fireside feeling his fair\\nwhisker without thinking that he was meditating on it that if joe\\nknew it i never afterwards could see him glance however casually at\\nyesterdayâ\\x80\\x99s meat or pudding when it came on todayâ\\x80\\x99s table without\\nthinking that he was debating whether i had been in the pantry that\\nif joe knew it and at any subsequent period of our joint domestic life\\nremarked that his beer was flat or thick the conviction that he\\nsuspected tar in it would bring a rush of blood to my face in a word\\ni was too cowardly to do what i knew to be right as i had been too\\ncowardly to avoid doing what i knew to be wrong i had had no\\nintercourse with the world at that time and i imitated none of its\\nmany inhabitants who act in this manner quite an untaught genius i\\nmade the discovery of the line of action for myself\\n\\nas i was sleepy before we were far away from the prisonship joe took\\nme on his back again and carried me home he must have had a tiresome\\njourney of it for mr wopsle being knocked up was in such a very bad\\ntemper that if the church had been thrown open he would probably have\\nexcommunicated the whole expedition beginning with joe and myself in\\nhis lay capacity he persisted in sitting down in the damp to such an\\ninsane extent that when his coat was taken off to be dried at the\\nkitchen fire the circumstantial evidence on his trousers would have\\nhanged him if it had been a capital offence\\n\\nby that time i was staggering on the kitchen floor like a little\\ndrunkard through having been newly set upon my feet and through\\nhaving been fast asleep and through waking in the heat and lights and\\nnoise of tongues as i came to myself with the aid of a heavy thump\\nbetween the shoulders and the restorative exclamation â\\x80\\x9cyah was there\\never such a boy as thisâ\\x80\\x9d from my sister i found joe telling them\\nabout the convictâ\\x80\\x99s confession and all the visitors suggesting\\ndifferent ways by which he had got into the pantry mr pumblechook\\nmade out after carefully surveying the premises that he had first got\\nupon the roof of the forge and had then got upon the roof of the\\nhouse and had then let himself down the kitchen chimney by a rope made\\nof his bedding cut into strips and as mr pumblechook was very\\npositive and drove his own chaisecartâ\\x80\\x94over everybodyâ\\x80\\x94it was agreed\\nthat it must be so mr wopsle indeed wildly cried out â\\x80\\x9cnoâ\\x80\\x9d with\\nthe feeble malice of a tired man but as he had no theory and no coat\\non he was unanimously set at naughtâ\\x80\\x94not to mention his smoking hard\\nbehind as he stood with his back to the kitchen fire to draw the damp\\nout which was not calculated to inspire confidence\\n\\nthis was all i heard that night before my sister clutched me as a\\nslumberous offence to the companyâ\\x80\\x99s eyesight and assisted me up to bed\\nwith such a strong hand that i seemed to have fifty boots on and to be\\ndangling them all against the edges of the stairs my state of mind as\\ni have described it began before i was up in the morning and lasted\\nlong after the subject had died out and had ceased to be mentioned\\nsaving on exceptional occasions\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter vii\\n\\n\\nat the time when i stood in the churchyard reading the family\\ntombstones i had just enough learning to be able to spell them out my\\nconstruction even of their simple meaning was not very correct for i\\nread â\\x80\\x9cwife of the aboveâ\\x80\\x9d as a complimentary reference to my fatherâ\\x80\\x99s\\nexaltation to a better world and if any one of my deceased relations\\nhad been referred to as â\\x80\\x9cbelowâ\\x80\\x9d i have no doubt i should have formed\\nthe worst opinions of that member of the family neither were my\\nnotions of the theological positions to which my catechism bound me at\\nall accurate for i have a lively remembrance that i supposed my\\ndeclaration that i was to â\\x80\\x9cwalk in the same all the days of my lifeâ\\x80\\x9d\\nlaid me under an obligation always to go through the village from our\\nhouse in one particular direction and never to vary it by turning down\\nby the wheelwrightâ\\x80\\x99s or up by the mill\\n\\nwhen i was old enough i was to be apprenticed to joe and until i\\ncould assume that dignity i was not to be what mrs joe called\\nâ\\x80\\x9cpompeyedâ\\x80\\x9d or as i render it pampered therefore i was not only\\noddboy about the forge but if any neighbour happened to want an extra\\nboy to frighten birds or pick up stones or do any such job i was\\nfavoured with the employment in order however that our superior\\nposition might not be compromised thereby a moneybox was kept on the\\nkitchen mantelshelf into which it was publicly made known that all my\\nearnings were dropped i have an impression that they were to be\\ncontributed eventually towards the liquidation of the national debt\\nbut i know i had no hope of any personal participation in the treasure\\n\\nmr wopsleâ\\x80\\x99s greataunt kept an evening school in the village that is\\nto say she was a ridiculous old woman of limited means and unlimited\\ninfirmity who used to go to sleep from six to seven every evening in\\nthe society of youth who paid two pence per week each for the\\nimproving opportunity of seeing her do it she rented a small cottage\\nand mr wopsle had the room upstairs where we students used to\\noverhear him reading aloud in a most dignified and terrific manner and\\noccasionally bumping on the ceiling there was a fiction that mr\\nwopsle â\\x80\\x9cexaminedâ\\x80\\x9d the scholars once a quarter what he did on those\\noccasions was to turn up his cuffs stick up his hair and give us mark\\nantonyâ\\x80\\x99s oration over the body of caesar this was always followed by\\ncollinsâ\\x80\\x99s ode on the passions wherein i particularly venerated mr\\nwopsle as revenge throwing his bloodstained sword in thunder down and\\ntaking the wardenouncing trumpet with a withering look it was not\\nwith me then as it was in later life when i fell into the society of\\nthe passions and compared them with collins and wopsle rather to the\\ndisadvantage of both gentlemen\\n\\nmr wopsleâ\\x80\\x99s greataunt besides keeping this educational institution\\nkept in the same roomâ\\x80\\x94a little general shop she had no idea what stock\\nshe had or what the price of anything in it was but there was a\\nlittle greasy memorandumbook kept in a drawer which served as a\\ncatalogue of prices and by this oracle biddy arranged all the shop\\ntransactions biddy was mr wopsleâ\\x80\\x99s greatauntâ\\x80\\x99s granddaughter i\\nconfess myself quite unequal to the working out of the problem what\\nrelation she was to mr wopsle she was an orphan like myself like me\\ntoo had been brought up by hand she was most noticeable i thought\\nin respect of her extremities for her hair always wanted brushing\\nher hands always wanted washing and her shoes always wanted mending\\nand pulling up at heel this description must be received with a\\nweekday limitation on sundays she went to church elaborated\\n\\nmuch of my unassisted self and more by the help of biddy than of mr\\nwopsleâ\\x80\\x99s greataunt i struggled through the alphabet as if it had been\\na bramblebush getting considerably worried and scratched by every\\nletter after that i fell among those thieves the nine figures who\\nseemed every evening to do something new to disguise themselves and\\nbaffle recognition but at last i began in a purblind groping way to\\nread write and cipher on the very smallest scale\\n\\none night i was sitting in the chimney corner with my slate expending\\ngreat efforts on the production of a letter to joe i think it must\\nhave been a full year after our hunt upon the marshes for it was a\\nlong time after and it was winter and a hard frost with an alphabet\\non the hearth at my feet for reference i contrived in an hour or two\\nto print and smear this epistleâ\\x80\\x94\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmi deer jo i ope u r krwite well i ope i shal son b habell 4 2 teedge\\nu jo an then we shorl b so glodd an wen i m prengtd 2 u jo wot larx an\\nbleve me inf xn pipâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\nthere was no indispensable necessity for my communicating with joe by\\nletter inasmuch as he sat beside me and we were alone but i delivered\\nthis written communication slate and all with my own hand and joe\\nreceived it as a miracle of erudition\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci say pip old chapâ\\x80\\x9d cried joe opening his blue eyes wide â\\x80\\x9cwhat a\\nscholar you are anâ\\x80\\x99t youâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci should like to beâ\\x80\\x9d said i glancing at the slate as he held it\\nwith a misgiving that the writing was rather hilly\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhy hereâ\\x80\\x99s a jâ\\x80\\x9d said joe â\\x80\\x9cand a o equal to anythink hereâ\\x80\\x99s a j and\\na o pip and a jo joeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nillustration\\n\\ni had never heard joe read aloud to any greater extent than this\\nmonosyllable and i had observed at church last sunday when i\\naccidentally held our prayerbook upside down that it seemed to suit\\nhis convenience quite as well as if it had been all right wishing to\\nembrace the present occasion of finding out whether in teaching joe i\\nshould have to begin quite at the beginning i said â\\x80\\x9cah but read the\\nrest joâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthe rest eh pipâ\\x80\\x9d said joe looking at it with a slow searching\\neye â\\x80\\x9cone two three why hereâ\\x80\\x99s three js and three os and three\\njo joes in it pipâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni leaned over joe and with the aid of my forefinger read him the\\nwhole letter\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9castonishingâ\\x80\\x9d said joe when i had finished â\\x80\\x9cyou are a scholarâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9chow do you spell gargery joeâ\\x80\\x9d i asked him with a modest patronage\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci donâ\\x80\\x99t spell it at allâ\\x80\\x9d said joe\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbut supposing you didâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cit canâ\\x80\\x99t be supposedâ\\x80\\x9d said joe â\\x80\\x9cthoâ\\x80\\x99 iâ\\x80\\x99m uncommon fond of reading\\ntooâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9care you joeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9concommon give meâ\\x80\\x9d said joe â\\x80\\x9ca good book or a good newspaper and\\nsit me down afore a good fire and i ask no better lordâ\\x80\\x9d he\\ncontinued after rubbing his knees a little â\\x80\\x9cwhen you do come to a j\\nand a o and says you â\\x80\\x98here at last is a jo joeâ\\x80\\x99 how interesting\\nreading isâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni derived from this that joeâ\\x80\\x99s education like steam was yet in its\\ninfancy pursuing the subject i inquiredâ\\x80\\x94\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cdidnâ\\x80\\x99t you ever go to school joe when you were as little as meâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cno pipâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhy didnâ\\x80\\x99t you ever go to school joe when you were as little as meâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwell pipâ\\x80\\x9d said joe taking up the poker and settling himself to his\\nusual occupation when he was thoughtful of slowly raking the fire\\nbetween the lower bars â\\x80\\x9ciâ\\x80\\x99ll tell you my father pip he were given\\nto drink and when he were overtook with drink he hammered away at my\\nmother most onmerciful it were aâ\\x80\\x99most the only hammering he did\\nindeed â\\x80\\x99xcepting at myself and he hammered at me with a wigor only to\\nbe equalled by the wigor with which he didnâ\\x80\\x99t hammer at his\\nanwilâ\\x80\\x94youâ\\x80\\x99re a listening and understanding pipâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyes joeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cconsequence my mother and me we ran away from my father several\\ntimes and then my mother sheâ\\x80\\x99d go out to work and sheâ\\x80\\x99d say â\\x80\\x9cjoeâ\\x80\\x9d\\nsheâ\\x80\\x99d say â\\x80\\x9cnow please god you shall have some schooling childâ\\x80\\x9d and\\nsheâ\\x80\\x99d put me to school but my father were that good in his hart that\\nhe couldnâ\\x80\\x99t abear to be without us so heâ\\x80\\x99d come with a most\\ntremenjous crowd and make such a row at the doors of the houses where\\nwe was that they used to be obligated to have no more to do with us\\nand to give us up to him and then he took us home and hammered us\\nwhich you see pipâ\\x80\\x9d said joe pausing in his meditative raking of the\\nfire and looking at me â\\x80\\x9cwere a drawback on my learningâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ccertainly poor joeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthough mind you pipâ\\x80\\x9d said joe with a judicial touch or two of the\\npoker on the top bar â\\x80\\x9crendering unto all their doo and maintaining\\nequal justice betwixt man and man my father were that good in his\\nhart donâ\\x80\\x99t you seeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni didnâ\\x80\\x99t see but i didnâ\\x80\\x99t say so\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwellâ\\x80\\x9d joe pursued â\\x80\\x9csomebody must keep the pot abiling pip or the\\npot wonâ\\x80\\x99t bile donâ\\x80\\x99t you knowâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni saw that and said so\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cconsequence my father didnâ\\x80\\x99t make objections to my going to work so\\ni went to work at my present calling which were his too if he would\\nhave followed it and i worked tolerable hard i assure you pip in\\ntime i were able to keep him and i kep him till he went off in a\\npurple leptic fit and it were my intentions to have had put upon his\\ntombstone that whatsumeâ\\x80\\x99er the failings on his part remember reader\\nhe were that good in his heartâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\njoe recited this couplet with such manifest pride and careful\\nperspicuity that i asked him if he had made it himself\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci made itâ\\x80\\x9d said joe â\\x80\\x9cmy own self i made it in a moment it was like\\nstriking out a horseshoe complete in a single blow i never was so\\nmuch surprised in all my lifeâ\\x80\\x94couldnâ\\x80\\x99t credit my own edâ\\x80\\x94to tell you\\nthe truth hardly believed it were my own ed as i was saying pip\\nit were my intentions to have had it cut over him but poetry costs\\nmoney cut it how you will small or large and it were not done not\\nto mention bearers all the money that could be spared were wanted for\\nmy mother she were in poor elth and quite broke she werenâ\\x80\\x99t long of\\nfollowing poor soul and her share of peace come round at lastâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\njoeâ\\x80\\x99s blue eyes turned a little watery he rubbed first one of them\\nand then the other in a most uncongenial and uncomfortable manner\\nwith the round knob on the top of the poker\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cit were but lonesome thenâ\\x80\\x9d said joe â\\x80\\x9cliving here alone and i got\\nacquainted with your sister now pipâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94joe looked firmly at me as if\\nhe knew i was not going to agree with himâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cyour sister is a fine\\nfigure of a womanâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni could not help looking at the fire in an obvious state of doubt\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhatever family opinions or whatever the worldâ\\x80\\x99s opinions on that\\nsubject may be pip your sister isâ\\x80\\x9d joe tapped the top bar with the\\npoker after every word following â\\x80\\x9cafinefigureâ\\x80\\x94ofâ\\x80\\x94aâ\\x80\\x94womanâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni could think of nothing better to say than â\\x80\\x9ci am glad you think so\\njoeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cso am iâ\\x80\\x9d returned joe catching me up â\\x80\\x9ci am glad i think so pip\\na little redness or a little matter of bone here or there what does\\nit signify to meâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni sagaciously observed if it didnâ\\x80\\x99t signify to him to whom did it\\nsignify\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ccertainlyâ\\x80\\x9d assented joe â\\x80\\x9cthatâ\\x80\\x99s it youâ\\x80\\x99re right old chap when i\\ngot acquainted with your sister it were the talk how she was bringing\\nyou up by hand very kind of her too all the folks said and i said\\nalong with all the folks as to youâ\\x80\\x9d joe pursued with a countenance\\nexpressive of seeing something very nasty indeed â\\x80\\x9cif you could have\\nbeen aware how small and flabby and mean you was dear me youâ\\x80\\x99d have\\nformed the most contemptible opinion of yourselfâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nnot exactly relishing this i said â\\x80\\x9cnever mind me joeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbut i did mind you pipâ\\x80\\x9d he returned with tender simplicity â\\x80\\x9cwhen i\\noffered to your sister to keep company and to be asked in church at\\nsuch times as she was willing and ready to come to the forge i said to\\nher â\\x80\\x98and bring the poor little child god bless the poor little\\nchildâ\\x80\\x99 i said to your sister â\\x80\\x98thereâ\\x80\\x99s room for him at the forgeâ\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni broke out crying and begging pardon and hugged joe round the neck\\nwho dropped the poker to hug me and to say â\\x80\\x9cever the best of friends\\nanâ\\x80\\x99t us pip donâ\\x80\\x99t cry old chapâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nwhen this little interruption was over joe resumedâ\\x80\\x94\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwell you see pip and here we are thatâ\\x80\\x99s about where it lights\\nhere we are now when you take me in hand in my learning pip and i\\ntell you beforehand i am awful dull most awful dull mrs joe mustnâ\\x80\\x99t\\nsee too much of what weâ\\x80\\x99re up to it must be done as i may say on the\\nsly and why on the sly iâ\\x80\\x99ll tell you why pipâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nhe had taken up the poker again without which i doubt if he could\\nhave proceeded in his demonstration\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyour sister is given to governmentâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cgiven to government joeâ\\x80\\x9d i was startled for i had some shadowy idea\\nand i am afraid i must add hope that joe had divorced her in a\\nfavour of the lords of the admiralty or treasury\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cgiven to governmentâ\\x80\\x9d said joe â\\x80\\x9cwhich i meantersay the government of\\nyou and myselfâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cohâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cand she anâ\\x80\\x99t over partial to having scholars on the premisesâ\\x80\\x9d joe\\ncontinued â\\x80\\x9cand in partickler would not be over partial to my being a\\nscholar for fear as i might rise like a sort of rebel donâ\\x80\\x99t you\\nseeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni was going to retort with an inquiry and had got as far as â\\x80\\x9cwhyâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\nwhen joe stopped me\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cstay a bit i know what youâ\\x80\\x99re agoing to say pip stay a bit i\\ndonâ\\x80\\x99t deny that your sister comes the mogul over us now and again i\\ndonâ\\x80\\x99t deny that she do throw us backfalls and that she do drop down\\nupon us heavy at such times as when your sister is on the rampage\\npipâ\\x80\\x9d joe sank his voice to a whisper and glanced at the door â\\x80\\x9ccandour\\ncompels fur to admit that she is a busterâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\njoe pronounced this word as if it began with at least twelve capital\\nbs\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhy donâ\\x80\\x99t i rise that were your observation when i broke it off\\npipâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyes joeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwellâ\\x80\\x9d said joe passing the poker into his left hand that he might\\nfeel his whisker and i had no hope of him whenever he took to that\\nplacid occupation â\\x80\\x9cyour sisterâ\\x80\\x99s a mastermind a mastermindâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhatâ\\x80\\x99s thatâ\\x80\\x9d i asked in some hope of bringing him to a stand but\\njoe was readier with his definition than i had expected and completely\\nstopped me by arguing circularly and answering with a fixed look\\nâ\\x80\\x9cherâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cand i ainâ\\x80\\x99t a mastermindâ\\x80\\x9d joe resumed when he had unfixed his look\\nand got back to his whisker â\\x80\\x9cand last of all pipâ\\x80\\x94and this i want to\\nsay very serious to you old chapâ\\x80\\x94i see so much in my poor mother of\\na woman drudging and slaving and breaking her honest hart and never\\ngetting no peace in her mortal days that iâ\\x80\\x99m dead afeerd of going\\nwrong in the way of not doing whatâ\\x80\\x99s right by a woman and iâ\\x80\\x99d fur\\nrather of the two go wrong the tâ\\x80\\x99other way and be a little\\nillconwenienced myself i wish it was only me that got put out pip i\\nwish there warnâ\\x80\\x99t no tickler for you old chap i wish i could take it\\nall on myself but this is the upanddownandstraight on it pip and\\ni hope youâ\\x80\\x99ll overlook shortcomingsâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nyoung as i was i believe that i dated a new admiration of joe from\\nthat night we were equals afterwards as we had been before but\\nafterwards at quiet times when i sat looking at joe and thinking about\\nhim i had a new sensation of feeling conscious that i was looking up\\nto joe in my heart\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9choweverâ\\x80\\x9d said joe rising to replenish the fire â\\x80\\x9chereâ\\x80\\x99s the\\ndutchclock aworking himself up to being equal to strike eight of â\\x80\\x99em\\nand sheâ\\x80\\x99s not come home yet i hope uncle pumblechookâ\\x80\\x99s mare maynâ\\x80\\x99t\\nhave set a forefoot on a piece oâ\\x80\\x99 ice and gone downâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nmrs joe made occasional trips with uncle pumblechook on marketdays\\nto assist him in buying such household stuffs and goods as required a\\nwomanâ\\x80\\x99s judgment uncle pumblechook being a bachelor and reposing no\\nconfidences in his domestic servant this was marketday and mrs joe\\nwas out on one of these expeditions\\n\\njoe made the fire and swept the hearth and then we went to the door to\\nlisten for the chaisecart it was a dry cold night and the wind blew\\nkeenly and the frost was white and hard a man would die tonight of\\nlying out on the marshes i thought and then i looked at the stars\\nand considered how awful it would be for a man to turn his face up to\\nthem as he froze to death and see no help or pity in all the\\nglittering multitude\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9chere comes the mareâ\\x80\\x9d said joe â\\x80\\x9cringing like a peal of bellsâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthe sound of her iron shoes upon the hard road was quite musical as\\nshe came along at a much brisker trot than usual we got a chair out\\nready for mrs joeâ\\x80\\x99s alighting and stirred up the fire that they might\\nsee a bright window and took a final survey of the kitchen that\\nnothing might be out of its place when we had completed these\\npreparations they drove up wrapped to the eyes mrs joe was soon\\nlanded and uncle pumblechook was soon down too covering the mare with\\na cloth and we were soon all in the kitchen carrying so much cold air\\nin with us that it seemed to drive all the heat out of the fire\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnowâ\\x80\\x9d said mrs joe unwrapping herself with haste and excitement and\\nthrowing her bonnet back on her shoulders where it hung by the strings\\nâ\\x80\\x9cif this boy ainâ\\x80\\x99t grateful this night he never will beâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni looked as grateful as any boy possibly could who was wholly\\nuninformed why he ought to assume that expression\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s only to be hopedâ\\x80\\x9d said my sister â\\x80\\x9cthat he wonâ\\x80\\x99t be pompeyed\\nbut i have my fearsâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cshe ainâ\\x80\\x99t in that line mumâ\\x80\\x9d said mr pumblechook â\\x80\\x9cshe knows\\nbetterâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nshe i looked at joe making the motion with my lips and eyebrows\\nâ\\x80\\x9csheâ\\x80\\x9d joe looked at me making the motion with his lips and\\neyebrows â\\x80\\x9csheâ\\x80\\x9d my sister catching him in the act he drew the back of\\nhis hand across his nose with his usual conciliatory air on such\\noccasions and looked at her\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwellâ\\x80\\x9d said my sister in her snappish way â\\x80\\x9cwhat are you staring at\\nis the house afireâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x94which some individualâ\\x80\\x9d joe politely hinted â\\x80\\x9cmentionedâ\\x80\\x94sheâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cand she is a she i supposeâ\\x80\\x9d said my sister â\\x80\\x9cunless you call miss\\nhavisham a he and i doubt if even youâ\\x80\\x99ll go so far as thatâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmiss havisham up townâ\\x80\\x9d said joe\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cis there any miss havisham down townâ\\x80\\x9d returned my sister\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cshe wants this boy to go and play there and of course heâ\\x80\\x99s going and\\nhe had better play thereâ\\x80\\x9d said my sister shaking her head at me as an\\nencouragement to be extremely light and sportive â\\x80\\x9cor iâ\\x80\\x99ll work himâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni had heard of miss havisham up townâ\\x80\\x94everybody for miles round had\\nheard of miss havisham up townâ\\x80\\x94as an immensely rich and grim lady who\\nlived in a large and dismal house barricaded against robbers and who\\nled a life of seclusion\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwell to be sureâ\\x80\\x9d said joe astounded â\\x80\\x9ci wonder how she come to know\\npipâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnoodleâ\\x80\\x9d cried my sister â\\x80\\x9cwho said she knew himâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x94which some individualâ\\x80\\x9d joe again politely hinted â\\x80\\x9cmentioned that\\nshe wanted him to go and play thereâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cand couldnâ\\x80\\x99t she ask uncle pumblechook if he knew of a boy to go and\\nplay there isnâ\\x80\\x99t it just barely possible that uncle pumblechook may be\\na tenant of hers and that he may sometimesâ\\x80\\x94we wonâ\\x80\\x99t say quarterly or\\nhalfyearly for that would be requiring too much of youâ\\x80\\x94but\\nsometimesâ\\x80\\x94go there to pay his rent and couldnâ\\x80\\x99t she then ask uncle\\npumblechook if he knew of a boy to go and play there and couldnâ\\x80\\x99t\\nuncle pumblechook being always considerate and thoughtful for\\nusâ\\x80\\x94though you may not think it josephâ\\x80\\x9d in a tone of the deepest\\nreproach as if he were the most callous of nephews â\\x80\\x9cthen mention this\\nboy standing prancing hereâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94which i solemnly declare i was not\\ndoingâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cthat i have for ever been a willing slave toâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cgood againâ\\x80\\x9d cried uncle pumblechook â\\x80\\x9cwell put prettily pointed\\ngood indeed now joseph you know the caseâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cno josephâ\\x80\\x9d said my sister still in a reproachful manner while joe\\napologetically drew the back of his hand across and across his nose\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou do not yetâ\\x80\\x94though you may not think itâ\\x80\\x94know the case you may\\nconsider that you do but you do not joseph for you do not know\\nthat uncle pumblechook being sensible that for anything we can tell\\nthis boyâ\\x80\\x99s fortune may be made by his going to miss havishamâ\\x80\\x99s has\\noffered to take him into town tonight in his own chaisecart and to\\nkeep him tonight and to take him with his own hands to miss\\nhavishamâ\\x80\\x99s tomorrow morning and loramussy meâ\\x80\\x9d cried my sister\\ncasting off her bonnet in sudden desperation â\\x80\\x9chere i stand talking to\\nmere mooncalfs with uncle pumblechook waiting and the mare catching\\ncold at the door and the boy grimed with crock and dirt from the hair\\nof his head to the sole of his footâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nwith that she pounced upon me like an eagle on a lamb and my face\\nwas squeezed into wooden bowls in sinks and my head was put under taps\\nof waterbutts and i was soaped and kneaded and towelled and\\nthumped and harrowed and rasped until i really was quite beside\\nmyself i may here remark that i suppose myself to be better\\nacquainted than any living authority with the ridgy effect of a\\nweddingring passing unsympathetically over the human countenance\\n\\nwhen my ablutions were completed i was put into clean linen of the\\nstiffest character like a young penitent into sackcloth and was\\ntrussed up in my tightest and fearfullest suit i was then delivered\\nover to mr pumblechook who formally received me as if he were the\\nsheriff and who let off upon me the speech that i knew he had been\\ndying to make all along â\\x80\\x9cboy be forever grateful to all friends but\\nespecially unto them which brought you up by handâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cgoodbye joeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cgod bless you pip old chapâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni had never parted from him before and what with my feelings and what\\nwith soapsuds i could at first see no stars from the chaisecart but\\nthey twinkled out one by one without throwing any light on the\\nquestions why on earth i was going to play at miss havishamâ\\x80\\x99s and what\\non earth i was expected to play at\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter viii\\n\\n\\nmr pumblechookâ\\x80\\x99s premises in the high street of the market town were\\nof a peppercorny and farinaceous character as the premises of a\\ncornchandler and seedsman should be it appeared to me that he must be\\na very happy man indeed to have so many little drawers in his shop\\nand i wondered when i peeped into one or two on the lower tiers and\\nsaw the tiedup brown paper packets inside whether the flowerseeds\\nand bulbs ever wanted of a fine day to break out of those jails and\\nbloom\\n\\nit was in the early morning after my arrival that i entertained this\\nspeculation on the previous night i had been sent straight to bed in\\nan attic with a sloping roof which was so low in the corner where the\\nbedstead was that i calculated the tiles as being within a foot of my\\neyebrows in the same early morning i discovered a singular affinity\\nbetween seeds and corduroys mr pumblechook wore corduroys and so did\\nhis shopman and somehow there was a general air and flavour about the\\ncorduroys so much in the nature of seeds and a general air and\\nflavour about the seeds so much in the nature of corduroys that i\\nhardly knew which was which the same opportunity served me for\\nnoticing that mr pumblechook appeared to conduct his business by\\nlooking across the street at the saddler who appeared to transact\\nhis business by keeping his eye on the coachmaker who appeared to\\nget on in life by putting his hands in his pockets and contemplating\\nthe baker who in his turn folded his arms and stared at the grocer\\nwho stood at his door and yawned at the chemist the watchmaker always\\nporing over a little desk with a magnifyingglass at his eye and\\nalways inspected by a group of smockfrocks poring over him through the\\nglass of his shopwindow seemed to be about the only person in the\\nhigh street whose trade engaged his attention\\n\\nmr pumblechook and i breakfasted at eight oâ\\x80\\x99clock in the parlour\\nbehind the shop while the shopman took his mug of tea and hunch of\\nbread and butter on a sack of peas in the front premises i considered\\nmr pumblechook wretched company besides being possessed by my\\nsisterâ\\x80\\x99s idea that a mortifying and penitential character ought to be\\nimparted to my dietâ\\x80\\x94besides giving me as much crumb as possible in\\ncombination with as little butter and putting such a quantity of warm\\nwater into my milk that it would have been more candid to have left the\\nmilk out altogetherâ\\x80\\x94his conversation consisted of nothing but\\narithmetic on my politely bidding him goodmorning he said\\npompously â\\x80\\x9cseven times nine boyâ\\x80\\x9d and how should i be able to\\nanswer dodged in that way in a strange place on an empty stomach i\\nwas hungry but before i had swallowed a morsel he began a running sum\\nthat lasted all through the breakfast â\\x80\\x9csevenâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cand fourâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cand\\neightâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cand sixâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cand twoâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cand tenâ\\x80\\x9d and so on and after each\\nfigure was disposed of it was as much as i could do to get a bite or a\\nsup before the next came while he sat at his ease guessing nothing\\nand eating bacon and hot roll in if i may be allowed the expression\\na gorging and gormandizing manner\\n\\nfor such reasons i was very glad when ten oâ\\x80\\x99clock came and we started\\nfor miss havishamâ\\x80\\x99s though i was not at all at my ease regarding the\\nmanner in which i should acquit myself under that ladyâ\\x80\\x99s roof within a\\nquarter of an hour we came to miss havishamâ\\x80\\x99s house which was of old\\nbrick and dismal and had a great many iron bars to it some of the\\nwindows had been walled up of those that remained all the lower were\\nrustily barred there was a courtyard in front and that was barred so\\nwe had to wait after ringing the bell until some one should come to\\nopen it while we waited at the gate i peeped in even then mr\\npumblechook said â\\x80\\x9cand fourteenâ\\x80\\x9d but i pretended not to hear him and\\nsaw that at the side of the house there was a large brewery no brewing\\nwas going on in it and none seemed to have gone on for a long long\\ntime\\n\\na window was raised and a clear voice demanded â\\x80\\x9cwhat nameâ\\x80\\x9d to which\\nmy conductor replied â\\x80\\x9cpumblechookâ\\x80\\x9d the voice returned â\\x80\\x9cquite rightâ\\x80\\x9d\\nand the window was shut again and a young lady came across the\\ncourtyard with keys in her hand\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthisâ\\x80\\x9d said mr pumblechook â\\x80\\x9cis pipâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthis is pip is itâ\\x80\\x9d returned the young lady who was very pretty and\\nseemed very proud â\\x80\\x9ccome in pipâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nmr pumblechook was coming in also when she stopped him with the gate\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cohâ\\x80\\x9d she said â\\x80\\x9cdid you wish to see miss havishamâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cif miss havisham wished to see meâ\\x80\\x9d returned mr pumblechook\\ndiscomfited\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cahâ\\x80\\x9d said the girl â\\x80\\x9cbut you see she donâ\\x80\\x99tâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nshe said it so finally and in such an undiscussible way that mr\\npumblechook though in a condition of ruffled dignity could not\\nprotest but he eyed me severelyâ\\x80\\x94as if i had done anything to\\nhimâ\\x80\\x94and departed with the words reproachfully delivered â\\x80\\x9cboy let\\nyour behaviour here be a credit unto them which brought you up by\\nhandâ\\x80\\x9d i was not free from apprehension that he would come back to\\npropound through the gate â\\x80\\x9cand sixteenâ\\x80\\x9d but he didnâ\\x80\\x99t\\n\\nmy young conductress locked the gate and we went across the courtyard\\nit was paved and clean but grass was growing in every crevice the\\nbrewery buildings had a little lane of communication with it and the\\nwooden gates of that lane stood open and all the brewery beyond stood\\nopen away to the high enclosing wall and all was empty and disused\\nthe cold wind seemed to blow colder there than outside the gate and it\\nmade a shrill noise in howling in and out at the open sides of the\\nbrewery like the noise of wind in the rigging of a ship at sea\\n\\nshe saw me looking at it and she said â\\x80\\x9cyou could drink without hurt\\nall the strong beer thatâ\\x80\\x99s brewed there now boyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci should think i could missâ\\x80\\x9d said i in a shy way\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbetter not try to brew beer there now or it would turn out sour boy\\ndonâ\\x80\\x99t you think soâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cit looks like it missâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnot that anybody means to tryâ\\x80\\x9d she added â\\x80\\x9cfor thatâ\\x80\\x99s all done with\\nand the place will stand as idle as it is till it falls as to strong\\nbeer thereâ\\x80\\x99s enough of it in the cellars already to drown the manor\\nhouseâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nillustration\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cis that the name of this house missâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cone of its names boyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cit has more than one then missâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cone more its other name was satis which is greek or latin or\\nhebrew or all threeâ\\x80\\x94or all one to meâ\\x80\\x94for enoughâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cenough houseâ\\x80\\x9d said i â\\x80\\x9cthatâ\\x80\\x99s a curious name missâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyesâ\\x80\\x9d she replied â\\x80\\x9cbut it meant more than it said it meant when it\\nwas given that whoever had this house could want nothing else they\\nmust have been easily satisfied in those days i should think but\\ndonâ\\x80\\x99t loiter boyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthough she called me â\\x80\\x9cboyâ\\x80\\x9d so often and with a carelessness that was\\nfar from complimentary she was of about my own age she seemed much\\nolder than i of course being a girl and beautiful and\\nselfpossessed and she was as scornful of me as if she had been\\noneandtwenty and a queen\\n\\nwe went into the house by a side door the great front entrance had two\\nchains across it outsideâ\\x80\\x94and the first thing i noticed was that the\\npassages were all dark and that she had left a candle burning there\\nshe took it up and we went through more passages and up a staircase\\nand still it was all dark and only the candle lighted us\\n\\nat last we came to the door of a room and she said â\\x80\\x9cgo inâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni answered more in shyness than politeness â\\x80\\x9cafter you missâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nto this she returned â\\x80\\x9cdonâ\\x80\\x99t be ridiculous boy i am not going inâ\\x80\\x9d\\nand scornfully walked away andâ\\x80\\x94what was worseâ\\x80\\x94took the candle with\\nher\\n\\nthis was very uncomfortable and i was half afraid however the only\\nthing to be done being to knock at the door i knocked and was told\\nfrom within to enter i entered therefore and found myself in a\\npretty large room well lighted with wax candles no glimpse of\\ndaylight was to be seen in it it was a dressingroom as i supposed\\nfrom the furniture though much of it was of forms and uses then quite\\nunknown to me but prominent in it was a draped table with a gilded\\nlookingglass and that i made out at first sight to be a fine ladyâ\\x80\\x99s\\ndressingtable\\n\\nwhether i should have made out this object so soon if there had been no\\nfine lady sitting at it i cannot say in an armchair with an elbow\\nresting on the table and her head leaning on that hand sat the\\nstrangest lady i have ever seen or shall ever see\\n\\nshe was dressed in rich materialsâ\\x80\\x94satins and lace and silksâ\\x80\\x94all of\\nwhite her shoes were white and she had a long white veil dependent\\nfrom her hair and she had bridal flowers in her hair but her hair was\\nwhite some bright jewels sparkled on her neck and on her hands and\\nsome other jewels lay sparkling on the table dresses less splendid\\nthan the dress she wore and halfpacked trunks were scattered about\\nshe had not quite finished dressing for she had but one shoe onâ\\x80\\x94the\\nother was on the table near her handâ\\x80\\x94her veil was but half arranged\\nher watch and chain were not put on and some lace for her bosom lay\\nwith those trinkets and with her handkerchief and gloves and some\\nflowers and a prayerbook all confusedly heaped about the\\nlookingglass\\n\\nit was not in the first few moments that i saw all these things though\\ni saw more of them in the first moments than might be supposed but i\\nsaw that everything within my view which ought to be white had been\\nwhite long ago and had lost its lustre and was faded and yellow i saw\\nthat the bride within the bridal dress had withered like the dress and\\nlike the flowers and had no brightness left but the brightness of her\\nsunken eyes i saw that the dress had been put upon the rounded figure\\nof a young woman and that the figure upon which it now hung loose had\\nshrunk to skin and bone once i had been taken to see some ghastly\\nwaxwork at the fair representing i know not what impossible personage\\nlying in state once i had been taken to one of our old marsh churches\\nto see a skeleton in the ashes of a rich dress that had been dug out of\\na vault under the church pavement now waxwork and skeleton seemed to\\nhave dark eyes that moved and looked at me i should have cried out if\\ni could\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwho is itâ\\x80\\x9d said the lady at the table\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cpip maâ\\x80\\x99amâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cpipâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmr pumblechookâ\\x80\\x99s boy maâ\\x80\\x99am comeâ\\x80\\x94to playâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ccome nearer let me look at you come closeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nit was when i stood before her avoiding her eyes that i took note of\\nthe surrounding objects in detail and saw that her watch had stopped\\nat twenty minutes to nine and that a clock in the room had stopped at\\ntwenty minutes to nine\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9clook at meâ\\x80\\x9d said miss havisham â\\x80\\x9cyou are not afraid of a woman who\\nhas never seen the sun since you were bornâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni regret to state that i was not afraid of telling the enormous lie\\ncomprehended in the answer â\\x80\\x9cnoâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cdo you know what i touch hereâ\\x80\\x9d she said laying her hands one upon\\nthe other on her left side\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyes maâ\\x80\\x99amâ\\x80\\x9d it made me think of the young man\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhat do i touchâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyour heartâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbrokenâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nshe uttered the word with an eager look and with strong emphasis and\\nwith a weird smile that had a kind of boast in it afterwards she kept\\nher hands there for a little while and slowly took them away as if\\nthey were heavy\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci am tiredâ\\x80\\x9d said miss havisham â\\x80\\x9ci want diversion and i have done\\nwith men and women playâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni think it will be conceded by my most disputatious reader that she\\ncould hardly have directed an unfortunate boy to do anything in the\\nwide world more difficult to be done under the circumstances\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci sometimes have sick fanciesâ\\x80\\x9d she went on â\\x80\\x9cand i have a sick fancy\\nthat i want to see some play there thereâ\\x80\\x9d with an impatient movement\\nof the fingers of her right hand â\\x80\\x9cplay play playâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nfor a moment with the fear of my sisterâ\\x80\\x99s working me before my eyes i\\nhad a desperate idea of starting round the room in the assumed\\ncharacter of mr pumblechookâ\\x80\\x99s chaisecart but i felt myself so\\nunequal to the performance that i gave it up and stood looking at miss\\nhavisham in what i suppose she took for a dogged manner inasmuch as\\nshe said when we had taken a good look at each otherâ\\x80\\x94\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9care you sullen and obstinateâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cno maâ\\x80\\x99am i am very sorry for you and very sorry i canâ\\x80\\x99t play just\\nnow if you complain of me i shall get into trouble with my sister so\\ni would do it if i could but itâ\\x80\\x99s so new here and so strange and so\\nfineâ\\x80\\x94and melancholyâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d i stopped fearing i might say too much or had\\nalready said it and we took another look at each other\\n\\nbefore she spoke again she turned her eyes from me and looked at the\\ndress she wore and at the dressingtable and finally at herself in\\nthe lookingglass\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cso new to himâ\\x80\\x9d she muttered â\\x80\\x9cso old to me so strange to him so\\nfamiliar to me so melancholy to both of us call estellaâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nas she was still looking at the reflection of herself i thought she\\nwas still talking to herself and kept quiet\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ccall estellaâ\\x80\\x9d she repeated flashing a look at me â\\x80\\x9cyou can do that\\ncall estella at the doorâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nto stand in the dark in a mysterious passage of an unknown house\\nbawling estella to a scornful young lady neither visible nor\\nresponsive and feeling it a dreadful liberty so to roar out her name\\nwas almost as bad as playing to order but she answered at last and\\nher light came along the dark passage like a star\\n\\nmiss havisham beckoned her to come close and took up a jewel from the\\ntable and tried its effect upon her fair young bosom and against her\\npretty brown hair â\\x80\\x9cyour own one day my dear and you will use it\\nwell let me see you play cards with this boyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwith this boy why he is a common labouringboyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni thought i overheard miss havisham answerâ\\x80\\x94only it seemed so\\nunlikelyâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cwell you can break his heartâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhat do you play boyâ\\x80\\x9d asked estella of myself with the greatest\\ndisdain\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnothing but beggar my neighbour missâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbeggar himâ\\x80\\x9d said miss havisham to estella so we sat down to cards\\n\\nit was then i began to understand that everything in the room had\\nstopped like the watch and the clock a long time ago i noticed that\\nmiss havisham put down the jewel exactly on the spot from which she had\\ntaken it up as estella dealt the cards i glanced at the\\ndressingtable again and saw that the shoe upon it once white now\\nyellow had never been worn i glanced down at the foot from which the\\nshoe was absent and saw that the silk stocking on it once white now\\nyellow had been trodden ragged without this arrest of everything\\nthis standing still of all the pale decayed objects not even the\\nwithered bridal dress on the collapsed form could have looked so like\\ngraveclothes or the long veil so like a shroud\\n\\nso she sat corpselike as we played at cards the frillings and\\ntrimmings on her bridal dress looking like earthy paper i knew\\nnothing then of the discoveries that are occasionally made of bodies\\nburied in ancient times which fall to powder in the moment of being\\ndistinctly seen but i have often thought since that she must have\\nlooked as if the admission of the natural light of day would have\\nstruck her to dust\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9che calls the knaves jacks this boyâ\\x80\\x9d said estella with disdain\\nbefore our first game was out â\\x80\\x9cand what coarse hands he has and what\\nthick bootsâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni had never thought of being ashamed of my hands before but i began to\\nconsider them a very indifferent pair her contempt for me was so\\nstrong that it became infectious and i caught it\\n\\nshe won the game and i dealt i misdealt as was only natural when i\\nknew she was lying in wait for me to do wrong and she denounced me for\\na stupid clumsy labouringboy\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou say nothing of herâ\\x80\\x9d remarked miss havisham to me as she looked\\non â\\x80\\x9cshe says many hard things of you but you say nothing of her what\\ndo you think of herâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci donâ\\x80\\x99t like to sayâ\\x80\\x9d i stammered\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ctell me in my earâ\\x80\\x9d said miss havisham bending down\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci think she is very proudâ\\x80\\x9d i replied in a whisper\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9canything elseâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci think she is very prettyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9canything elseâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci think she is very insultingâ\\x80\\x9d she was looking at me then with a\\nlook of supreme aversion\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9canything elseâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci think i should like to go homeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cand never see her again though she is so prettyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci am not sure that i shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t like to see her again but i should\\nlike to go home nowâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou shall go soonâ\\x80\\x9d said miss havisham aloud â\\x80\\x9cplay the game outâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nsaving for the one weird smile at first i should have felt almost sure\\nthat miss havishamâ\\x80\\x99s face could not smile it had dropped into a\\nwatchful and brooding expressionâ\\x80\\x94most likely when all the things about\\nher had become transfixedâ\\x80\\x94and it looked as if nothing could ever lift\\nit up again her chest had dropped so that she stooped and her voice\\nhad dropped so that she spoke low and with a dead lull upon her\\naltogether she had the appearance of having dropped body and soul\\nwithin and without under the weight of a crushing blow\\n\\ni played the game to an end with estella and she beggared me she\\nthrew the cards down on the table when she had won them all as if she\\ndespised them for having been won of me\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhen shall i have you here againâ\\x80\\x9d said miss havisham â\\x80\\x9clet me thinkâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni was beginning to remind her that today was wednesday when she\\nchecked me with her former impatient movement of the fingers of her\\nright hand\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthere there i know nothing of days of the week i know nothing of\\nweeks of the year come again after six days you hearâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyes maâ\\x80\\x99amâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cestella take him down let him have something to eat and let him\\nroam and look about him while he eats go pipâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni followed the candle down as i had followed the candle up and she\\nstood it in the place where we had found it until she opened the side\\nentrance i had fancied without thinking about it that it must\\nnecessarily be nighttime the rush of the daylight quite confounded\\nme and made me feel as if i had been in the candlelight of the strange\\nroom many hours\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou are to wait here you boyâ\\x80\\x9d said estella and disappeared and\\nclosed the door\\n\\ni took the opportunity of being alone in the courtyard to look at my\\ncoarse hands and my common boots my opinion of those accessories was\\nnot favourable they had never troubled me before but they troubled me\\nnow as vulgar appendages i determined to ask joe why he had ever\\ntaught me to call those picturecards jacks which ought to be called\\nknaves i wished joe had been rather more genteelly brought up and\\nthen i should have been so too\\n\\nshe came back with some bread and meat and a little mug of beer she\\nput the mug down on the stones of the yard and gave me the bread and\\nmeat without looking at me as insolently as if i were a dog in\\ndisgrace i was so humiliated hurt spurned offended angry sorryâ\\x80\\x94i\\ncannot hit upon the right name for the smartâ\\x80\\x94god knows what its name\\nwasâ\\x80\\x94that tears started to my eyes the moment they sprang there the\\ngirl looked at me with a quick delight in having been the cause of\\nthem this gave me power to keep them back and to look at her so she\\ngave a contemptuous tossâ\\x80\\x94but with a sense i thought of having made\\ntoo sure that i was so woundedâ\\x80\\x94and left me\\n\\nbut when she was gone i looked about me for a place to hide my face\\nin and got behind one of the gates in the brewerylane and leaned my\\nsleeve against the wall there and leaned my forehead on it and cried\\nas i cried i kicked the wall and took a hard twist at my hair so\\nbitter were my feelings and so sharp was the smart without a name\\nthat needed counteraction\\n\\nmy sisterâ\\x80\\x99s bringing up had made me sensitive in the little world in\\nwhich children have their existence whosoever brings them up there is\\nnothing so finely perceived and so finely felt as injustice it may be\\nonly small injustice that the child can be exposed to but the child is\\nsmall and its world is small and its rockinghorse stands as many\\nhands high according to scale as a bigboned irish hunter within\\nmyself i had sustained from my babyhood a perpetual conflict with\\ninjustice i had known from the time when i could speak that my\\nsister in her capricious and violent coercion was unjust to me i had\\ncherished a profound conviction that her bringing me up by hand gave\\nher no right to bring me up by jerks through all my punishments\\ndisgraces fasts and vigils and other penitential performances i had\\nnursed this assurance and to my communing so much with it in a\\nsolitary and unprotected way i in great part refer the fact that i was\\nmorally timid and very sensitive\\n\\ni got rid of my injured feelings for the time by kicking them into the\\nbrewery wall and twisting them out of my hair and then i smoothed my\\nface with my sleeve and came from behind the gate the bread and meat\\nwere acceptable and the beer was warming and tingling and i was soon\\nin spirits to look about me\\n\\nto be sure it was a deserted place down to the pigeonhouse in the\\nbreweryyard which had been blown crooked on its pole by some high\\nwind and would have made the pigeons think themselves at sea if there\\nhad been any pigeons there to be rocked by it but there were no\\npigeons in the dovecot no horses in the stable no pigs in the sty\\nno malt in the storehouse no smells of grains and beer in the copper\\nor the vat all the uses and scents of the brewery might have\\nevaporated with its last reek of smoke in a byyard there was a\\nwilderness of empty casks which had a certain sour remembrance of\\nbetter days lingering about them but it was too sour to be accepted as\\na sample of the beer that was goneâ\\x80\\x94and in this respect i remember\\nthose recluses as being like most others\\n\\nbehind the furthest end of the brewery was a rank garden with an old\\nwall not so high but that i could struggle up and hold on long enough\\nto look over it and see that the rank garden was the garden of the\\nhouse and that it was overgrown with tangled weeds but that there was\\na track upon the green and yellow paths as if some one sometimes\\nwalked there and that estella was walking away from me even then but\\nshe seemed to be everywhere for when i yielded to the temptation\\npresented by the casks and began to walk on them i saw her walking\\non them at the end of the yard of casks she had her back towards me\\nand held her pretty brown hair spread out in her two hands and never\\nlooked round and passed out of my view directly so in the brewery\\nitselfâ\\x80\\x94by which i mean the large paved lofty place in which they used\\nto make the beer and where the brewing utensils still were when i\\nfirst went into it and rather oppressed by its gloom stood near the\\ndoor looking about me i saw her pass among the extinguished fires and\\nascend some light iron stairs and go out by a gallery high overhead\\nas if she were going out into the sky\\n\\nit was in this place and at this moment that a strange thing happened\\nto my fancy i thought it a strange thing then and i thought it a\\nstranger thing long afterwards i turned my eyesâ\\x80\\x94a little dimmed by\\nlooking up at the frosty lightâ\\x80\\x94towards a great wooden beam in a low\\nnook of the building near me on my right hand and i saw a figure\\nhanging there by the neck a figure all in yellow white with but one\\nshoe to the feet and it hung so that i could see that the faded\\ntrimmings of the dress were like earthy paper and that the face was\\nmiss havishamâ\\x80\\x99s with a movement going over the whole countenance as if\\nshe were trying to call to me in the terror of seeing the figure and\\nin the terror of being certain that it had not been there a moment\\nbefore i at first ran from it and then ran towards it and my terror\\nwas greatest of all when i found no figure there\\n\\nnothing less than the frosty light of the cheerful sky the sight of\\npeople passing beyond the bars of the courtyard gate and the reviving\\ninfluence of the rest of the bread and meat and beer would have\\nbrought me round even with those aids i might not have come to myself\\nas soon as i did but that i saw estella approaching with the keys to\\nlet me out she would have some fair reason for looking down upon me i\\nthought if she saw me frightened and she would have no fair reason\\n\\nshe gave me a triumphant glance in passing me as if she rejoiced that\\nmy hands were so coarse and my boots were so thick and she opened the\\ngate and stood holding it i was passing out without looking at her\\nwhen she touched me with a taunting hand\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhy donâ\\x80\\x99t you cryâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbecause i donâ\\x80\\x99t want toâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou doâ\\x80\\x9d said she â\\x80\\x9cyou have been crying till you are half blind and\\nyou are near crying again nowâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nshe laughed contemptuously pushed me out and locked the gate upon me\\ni went straight to mr pumblechookâ\\x80\\x99s and was immensely relieved to\\nfind him not at home so leaving word with the shopman on what day i\\nwas wanted at miss havishamâ\\x80\\x99s again i set off on the fourmile walk to\\nour forge pondering as i went along on all i had seen and deeply\\nrevolving that i was a common labouringboy that my hands were coarse\\nthat my boots were thick that i had fallen into a despicable habit of\\ncalling knaves jacks that i was much more ignorant than i had\\nconsidered myself last night and generally that i was in a lowlived\\nbad way\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter ix\\n\\n\\nwhen i reached home my sister was very curious to know all about miss\\nhavishamâ\\x80\\x99s and asked a number of questions and i soon found myself\\ngetting heavily bumped from behind in the nape of the neck and the\\nsmall of the back and having my face ignominiously shoved against the\\nkitchen wall because i did not answer those questions at sufficient\\nlength\\n\\nif a dread of not being understood be hidden in the breasts of other\\nyoung people to anything like the extent to which it used to be hidden\\nin mineâ\\x80\\x94which i consider probable as i have no particular reason to\\nsuspect myself of having been a monstrosityâ\\x80\\x94it is the key to many\\nreservations i felt convinced that if i described miss havishamâ\\x80\\x99s as\\nmy eyes had seen it i should not be understood not only that but i\\nfelt convinced that miss havisham too would not be understood and\\nalthough she was perfectly incomprehensible to me i entertained an\\nimpression that there would be something coarse and treacherous in my\\ndragging her as she really was to say nothing of miss estella before\\nthe contemplation of mrs joe consequently i said as little as i\\ncould and had my face shoved against the kitchen wall\\n\\nthe worst of it was that that bullying old pumblechook preyed upon by\\na devouring curiosity to be informed of all i had seen and heard came\\ngaping over in his chaisecart at teatime to have the details\\ndivulged to him and the mere sight of the torment with his fishy eyes\\nand mouth open his sandy hair inquisitively on end and his waistcoat\\nheaving with windy arithmetic made me vicious in my reticence\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwell boyâ\\x80\\x9d uncle pumblechook began as soon as he was seated in the\\nchair of honour by the fire â\\x80\\x9chow did you get on up townâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni answered â\\x80\\x9cpretty well sirâ\\x80\\x9d and my sister shook her fist at me\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cpretty wellâ\\x80\\x9d mr pumblechook repeated â\\x80\\x9cpretty well is no answer\\ntell us what you mean by pretty well boyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nwhitewash on the forehead hardens the brain into a state of obstinacy\\nperhaps anyhow with whitewash from the wall on my forehead my\\nobstinacy was adamantine i reflected for some time and then answered\\nas if i had discovered a new idea â\\x80\\x9ci mean pretty wellâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nmy sister with an exclamation of impatience was going to fly at meâ\\x80\\x94i\\nhad no shadow of defence for joe was busy in the forgeâ\\x80\\x94when mr\\npumblechook interposed with â\\x80\\x9cno donâ\\x80\\x99t lose your temper leave this lad\\nto me maâ\\x80\\x99am leave this lad to meâ\\x80\\x9d mr pumblechook then turned me\\ntowards him as if he were going to cut my hair and saidâ\\x80\\x94\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cfirst to get our thoughts in order fortythree penceâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni calculated the consequences of replying â\\x80\\x9cfour hundred poundâ\\x80\\x9d and\\nfinding them against me went as near the answer as i couldâ\\x80\\x94which was\\nsomewhere about eightpence off mr pumblechook then put me through my\\npencetable from â\\x80\\x9ctwelve pence make one shillingâ\\x80\\x9d up to â\\x80\\x9cforty pence\\nmake three and fourpenceâ\\x80\\x9d and then triumphantly demanded as if he had\\ndone for me â\\x80\\x9cnow how much is fortythree penceâ\\x80\\x9d to which i\\nreplied after a long interval of reflection â\\x80\\x9ci donâ\\x80\\x99t knowâ\\x80\\x9d and i was\\nso aggravated that i almost doubt if i did know\\n\\nmr pumblechook worked his head like a screw to screw it out of me and\\nsaid â\\x80\\x9cis fortythree pence seven and sixpence three fardens for\\ninstanceâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyesâ\\x80\\x9d said i and although my sister instantly boxed my ears it was\\nhighly gratifying to me to see that the answer spoilt his joke and\\nbrought him to a dead stop\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cboy what like is miss havishamâ\\x80\\x9d mr pumblechook began again when he\\nhad recovered folding his arms tight on his chest and applying the\\nscrew\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cvery tall and darkâ\\x80\\x9d i told him\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cis she uncleâ\\x80\\x9d asked my sister\\n\\nmr pumblechook winked assent from which i at once inferred that he\\nhad never seen miss havisham for she was nothing of the kind\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cgoodâ\\x80\\x9d said mr pumblechook conceitedly â\\x80\\x9cthis is the way to have\\nhim we are beginning to hold our own i think mumâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci am sure uncleâ\\x80\\x9d returned mrs joe â\\x80\\x9ci wish you had him always you\\nknow so well how to deal with himâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnow boy what was she adoing of when you went in todayâ\\x80\\x9d asked mr\\npumblechook\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cshe was sittingâ\\x80\\x9d i answered â\\x80\\x9cin a black velvet coachâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nmr pumblechook and mrs joe stared at one anotherâ\\x80\\x94as they well\\nmightâ\\x80\\x94and both repeated â\\x80\\x9cin a black velvet coachâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyesâ\\x80\\x9d said i â\\x80\\x9cand miss estellaâ\\x80\\x94thatâ\\x80\\x99s her niece i thinkâ\\x80\\x94handed her\\nin cake and wine at the coachwindow on a gold plate and we all had\\ncake and wine on gold plates and i got up behind the coach to eat\\nmine because she told me toâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwas anybody else thereâ\\x80\\x9d asked mr pumblechook\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cfour dogsâ\\x80\\x9d said i\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9clarge or smallâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cimmenseâ\\x80\\x9d said i â\\x80\\x9cand they fought for vealcutlets out of a silver\\nbasketâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nmr pumblechook and mrs joe stared at one another again in utter\\namazement i was perfectly franticâ\\x80\\x94a reckless witness under the\\ntortureâ\\x80\\x94and would have told them anything\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhere was this coach in the name of graciousâ\\x80\\x9d asked my sister\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cin miss havishamâ\\x80\\x99s roomâ\\x80\\x9d they stared again â\\x80\\x9cbut there werenâ\\x80\\x99t any\\nhorses to itâ\\x80\\x9d i added this saving clause in the moment of rejecting\\nfour richly caparisoned coursers which i had had wild thoughts of\\nharnessing\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ccan this be possible uncleâ\\x80\\x9d asked mrs joe â\\x80\\x9cwhat can the boy meanâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ciâ\\x80\\x99ll tell you mumâ\\x80\\x9d said mr pumblechook â\\x80\\x9cmy opinion is itâ\\x80\\x99s a\\nsedanchair sheâ\\x80\\x99s flighty you knowâ\\x80\\x94very flightyâ\\x80\\x94quite flighty\\nenough to pass her days in a sedanchairâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cdid you ever see her in it uncleâ\\x80\\x9d asked mrs joe\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9chow could iâ\\x80\\x9d he returned forced to the admission â\\x80\\x9cwhen i never see\\nher in my life never clapped eyes upon herâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cgoodness uncle and yet you have spoken to herâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhy donâ\\x80\\x99t you knowâ\\x80\\x9d said mr pumblechook testily â\\x80\\x9cthat when i have\\nbeen there i have been took up to the outside of her door and the\\ndoor has stood ajar and she has spoke to me that way donâ\\x80\\x99t say you\\ndonâ\\x80\\x99t know that mum howsever the boy went there to play what did\\nyou play at boyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwe played with flagsâ\\x80\\x9d i said i beg to observe that i think of\\nmyself with amazement when i recall the lies i told on this occasion\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cflagsâ\\x80\\x9d echoed my sister\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyesâ\\x80\\x9d said i â\\x80\\x9cestella waved a blue flag and i waved a red one and\\nmiss havisham waved one sprinkled all over with little gold stars out\\nat the coachwindow and then we all waved our swords and hurrahedâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cswordsâ\\x80\\x9d repeated my sister â\\x80\\x9cwhere did you get swords fromâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cout of a cupboardâ\\x80\\x9d said i â\\x80\\x9cand i saw pistols in itâ\\x80\\x94and jamâ\\x80\\x94and\\npills and there was no daylight in the room but it was all lighted up\\nwith candlesâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthatâ\\x80\\x99s true mumâ\\x80\\x9d said mr pumblechook with a grave nod â\\x80\\x9cthatâ\\x80\\x99s the\\nstate of the case for that much iâ\\x80\\x99ve seen myselfâ\\x80\\x9d and then they both\\nstared at me and i with an obtrusive show of artlessness on my\\ncountenance stared at them and plaited the right leg of my trousers\\nwith my right hand\\n\\nif they had asked me any more questions i should undoubtedly have\\nbetrayed myself for i was even then on the point of mentioning that\\nthere was a balloon in the yard and should have hazarded the statement\\nbut for my invention being divided between that phenomenon and a bear\\nin the brewery they were so much occupied however in discussing the\\nmarvels i had already presented for their consideration that i\\nescaped the subject still held them when joe came in from his work to\\nhave a cup of tea to whom my sister more for the relief of her own\\nmind than for the gratification of his related my pretended\\nexperiences\\n\\nnow when i saw joe open his blue eyes and roll them all round the\\nkitchen in helpless amazement i was overtaken by penitence but only\\nas regarded himâ\\x80\\x94not in the least as regarded the other two towards\\njoe and joe only i considered myself a young monster while they sat\\ndebating what results would come to me from miss havishamâ\\x80\\x99s\\nacquaintance and favour they had no doubt that miss havisham would â\\x80\\x9cdo\\nsomethingâ\\x80\\x9d for me their doubts related to the form that something\\nwould take my sister stood out for â\\x80\\x9cpropertyâ\\x80\\x9d mr pumblechook was in\\nfavour of a handsome premium for binding me apprentice to some genteel\\ntradeâ\\x80\\x94say the corn and seed trade for instance joe fell into the\\ndeepest disgrace with both for offering the bright suggestion that i\\nmight only be presented with one of the dogs who had fought for the\\nvealcutlets â\\x80\\x9cif a foolâ\\x80\\x99s head canâ\\x80\\x99t express better opinions than\\nthatâ\\x80\\x9d said my sister â\\x80\\x9cand you have got any work to do you had better\\ngo and do itâ\\x80\\x9d so he went\\n\\nafter mr pumblechook had driven off and when my sister was washing\\nup i stole into the forge to joe and remained by him until he had\\ndone for the night then i said â\\x80\\x9cbefore the fire goes out joe i\\nshould like to tell you somethingâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cshould you pipâ\\x80\\x9d said joe drawing his shoeingstool near the forge\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthen tell us what is it pipâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cjoeâ\\x80\\x9d said i taking hold of his rolledup shirt sleeve and twisting\\nit between my finger and thumb â\\x80\\x9cyou remember all that about miss\\nhavishamâ\\x80\\x99sâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9crememberâ\\x80\\x9d said joe â\\x80\\x9ci believe you wonderfulâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s a terrible thing joe it ainâ\\x80\\x99t trueâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhat are you telling of pipâ\\x80\\x9d cried joe falling back in the greatest\\namazement â\\x80\\x9cyou donâ\\x80\\x99t mean to say itâ\\x80\\x99sâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyes i do itâ\\x80\\x99s lies joeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbut not all of it why sure you donâ\\x80\\x99t mean to say pip that there was\\nno black welwet coâ\\x80\\x94ehâ\\x80\\x9d for i stood shaking my head â\\x80\\x9cbut at least\\nthere was dogs pip come pipâ\\x80\\x9d said joe persuasively â\\x80\\x9cif there\\nwarnâ\\x80\\x99t no

at all of the kindâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nas i fixed my eyes hopelessly on joe joe contemplated me in dismay\\nâ\\x80\\x9cpip old chap this wonâ\\x80\\x99t do old fellow i say where do you expect\\nto go

donâ\\x80\\x99t know what possessed me joeâ\\x80\\x9d i replied letting his shirt\\nsleeve go and sitting down in the ashes at his feet hanging my head\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbut i wish you hadnâ\\x80\\x99t taught me to call knaves at cards jacks and i\\nwish my boots werenâ\\x80\\x99t so thick nor my hands so coarseâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nand then i told joe that i felt very miserable and that i hadnâ\\x80\\x99t been\\nable to explain myself to mrs joe and pumblechook who were so rude to\\nme and that there had been a beautiful young lady at miss havishamâ\\x80\\x99s\\nwho was dreadfully proud and that she had said i was common and that\\ni knew i was common and that i wished i was not common and that the\\nlies had come of it somehow though i didnâ\\x80\\x99t know how\\n\\nthis was a case of metaphysics at least as difficult for joe to deal\\nwith as for me but joe took the case altogether out of the region of\\nmetaphysics and by that means vanquished it\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthereâ\\x80\\x99s one thing you may be sure of pipâ\\x80\\x9d said joe after some\\nrumination â\\x80\\x9cnamely that lies is lies howsever they come they didnâ\\x80\\x99t\\nought to come and they come from the father of lies and work round to\\nthe same donâ\\x80\\x99t you tell no more of â\\x80\\x99em pip that ainâ\\x80\\x99t the way to\\nget out of being common old chap and

scholarâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cno i am ignorant and backward joeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhy see what a letter you wrote last night wrote in print even iâ\\x80\\x99ve\\nseen

me itâ\\x80\\x99s only\\nthatâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwell pipâ\\x80\\x9d said joe â\\x80\\x9cbe it so or be it sonâ\\x80\\x99t you must be a common\\nscholar afore you can be a oncommon one i should hope the king upon\\nhis throne with his crown upon his ed canâ\\x80\\x99t sit and write his acts of\\nparliament in print without having begun when he were a unpromoted\\nprince with the alphabetâ\\x80\\x94ahâ\\x80\\x9d added joe with a shake of the head\\nthat was full of meaning â\\x80\\x9cand begun at a too and worked his way to z\\nand i know what that is to do though i canâ\\x80\\x99t say iâ\\x80\\x99ve exactly done\\nitâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthere was some hope in this piece of wisdom and it rather encouraged\\nme\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhether common ones as to callings and earningsâ\\x80\\x9d pursued joe\\nreflectively â\\x80\\x9cmightnâ\\x80\\x99t be the better of continuing for to keep company\\nwith common ones instead of going out to play with oncommon\\nonesâ\\x80\\x94which reminds me to hope that there were a flag perhapsâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cno joeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ciâ\\x80\\x99m sorry there werenâ\\x80\\x99t a flag pip whether that might be or\\nmightnâ\\x80\\x99t be is a thing as canâ\\x80\\x99t be looked into now without putting\\nyour sister on the rampage and thatâ\\x80\\x99s a thing not to be thought of as\\nbeing done intentional lookee here pip at what is said to you by a\\ntrue friend which this to you the true friend say if you canâ\\x80\\x99t get to\\nbe oncommon through going straight youâ\\x80\\x99ll never get to do it through\\ngoing crooked so donâ\\x80\\x99t tell no more on â\\x80\\x99em pip and live well and die\\nhappyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou are not angry with me joeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cno old chap but bearing in mind that them were which i meantersay of\\na stunning and outdacious sortâ\\x80\\x94alluding to them which bordered on\\nwealcutlets and dogfightingâ\\x80\\x94a sincere wellwisher would adwise pip\\ntheir being dropped into your meditations when you go upstairs to bed\\nthatâ\\x80\\x99s all old chap and donâ\\x80\\x99t never do it no moreâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nwhen i got up to my little room and said my prayers i did not forget\\njoeâ\\x80\\x99s recommendation and yet my young mind was in that disturbed and\\nunthankful state that i thought long after i laid me down how common\\nestella would consider joe a mere blacksmith how thick his boots and\\nhow coarse his hands i thought how joe and my sister were then sitting\\nin the kitchen and how i had come up to bed from the kitchen and how\\nmiss havisham and estella never sat in a kitchen but were far above\\nthe level of such common doings i fell asleep recalling what i â\\x80\\x9cused\\nto doâ\\x80\\x9d when i was at miss havishamâ\\x80\\x99s as though i had been there weeks\\nor months instead of hours and as though it were quite an old subject\\nof remembrance instead of one that had arisen only that day\\n\\nthat was a memorable day to me for it made great changes in me but it\\nis the same with any life imagine one selected day struck out of it\\nand think how different its course would have been pause you who read\\nthis and think for a moment of the long chain of iron or gold of\\nthorns or flowers that would never have bound you but for the\\nformation of the first link on one memorable day\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter x\\n\\n\\nthe felicitous idea occurred to me a morning or two later when i woke\\nthat the best step i could take towards making myself uncommon was to\\nget out of biddy everything she knew in pursuance of this luminous\\nconception i mentioned to biddy when i went to mr wopsleâ\\x80\\x99s\\ngreatauntâ\\x80\\x99s at night that i had a particular reason for wishing to\\nget on in life and that i should feel very much obliged to her if she\\nwould impart all her learning to me biddy who was the most obliging\\nof girls immediately said she would and indeed began to carry out her\\npromise within five minutes\\n\\nthe educational scheme or course established by mr wopsleâ\\x80\\x99s greataunt\\nmay be resolved into the following synopsis the pupils ate apples and\\nput straws down one anotherâ\\x80\\x99s backs until mr wopsleâ\\x80\\x99s greataunt\\ncollected her energies and made an indiscriminate totter at them with\\na birchrod after receiving the charge with every mark of derision\\nthe pupils formed in line and buzzingly passed a ragged book from hand\\nto hand the book had an alphabet in it some figures and tables and a\\nlittle spellingâ\\x80\\x94that is to say it had had once as soon as this\\nvolume began to circulate mr wopsleâ\\x80\\x99s greataunt fell into a state of\\ncoma arising either from sleep or a rheumatic paroxysm the pupils\\nthen entered among themselves upon a competitive examination on the\\nsubject of boots with the view of ascertaining who could tread the\\nhardest upon whose toes this mental exercise lasted until biddy made a\\nrush at them and distributed three defaced bibles shaped as if they\\nhad been unskilfully cut off the chump end of something more\\nillegibly printed at the best than any curiosities of literature i have\\nsince met with speckled all over with ironmould and having various\\nspecimens of the insect world smashed between their leaves this part\\nof the course was usually lightened by several single combats between\\nbiddy and refractory students when the fights were over biddy gave\\nout the number of a page and then we all read aloud what we couldâ\\x80\\x94or\\nwhat we couldnâ\\x80\\x99tâ\\x80\\x94in a frightful chorus biddy leading with a high\\nshrill monotonous voice and none of us having the least notion of or\\nreverence for what we were reading about when this horrible din had\\nlasted a certain time it mechanically awoke mr wopsleâ\\x80\\x99s greataunt\\nwho staggered at a boy fortuitously and pulled his ears this was\\nunderstood to terminate the course for the evening and we emerged into\\nthe air with shrieks of intellectual victory it is fair to remark that\\nthere was no prohibition against any pupilâ\\x80\\x99s entertaining himself with\\na slate or even with the ink when there was any but that it was not\\neasy to pursue that branch of study in the winter season on account of\\nthe little general shop in which the classes were holdenâ\\x80\\x94and which was\\nalso mr wopsleâ\\x80\\x99s greatauntâ\\x80\\x99s sittingroom and bedchamberâ\\x80\\x94being but\\nfaintly illuminated through the agency of one lowspirited dipcandle\\nand no snuffers\\n\\nit appeared to me that it would take time to become uncommon under\\nthese circumstances nevertheless i resolved to try it and that very\\nevening biddy entered on our special agreement by imparting some\\ninformation from her little catalogue of prices under the head of\\nmoist sugar and lending me to copy at home a large old english d\\nwhich she had imitated from the heading of some newspaper and which i\\nsupposed until she told me what it was to be a design for a buckle\\n\\nof course there was a publichouse in the village and of course joe\\nliked sometimes to smoke his pipe there i had received strict orders\\nfrom my sister to call for him at the three jolly bargemen that\\nevening on my way from school and bring him home at my peril to the\\nthree jolly bargemen therefore i directed my steps\\n\\nthere was a bar at the jolly bargemen with some alarmingly long chalk\\nscores in it on the wall at the side of the door which seemed to me to\\nbe never paid off they had been there ever since i could remember and\\nhad grown more than i had but there was a quantity of chalk about our\\ncountry and perhaps the people neglected no opportunity of turning it\\nto account\\n\\nit being saturday night i found the landlord looking rather grimly at\\nthese records but as my business was with joe and not with him i\\nmerely wished him good evening and passed into the common room at the\\nend of the passage where there was a bright large kitchen fire and\\nwhere joe was smoking his pipe in company with mr wopsle and a\\nstranger joe greeted me as usual with â\\x80\\x9challoa pip old chapâ\\x80\\x9d and the\\nmoment he said that the stranger turned his head and looked at me\\n\\nhe was a secretlooking man whom i had never seen before his head was\\nall on one side and one of his eyes was half shut up as if he were\\ntaking aim at something with an invisible gun he had a pipe in his\\nmouth and he took it out and after slowly blowing all his smoke away\\nand looking hard at me all the time nodded so i nodded and then he\\nnodded again and made room on the settle beside him that i might sit\\ndown there\\n\\nbut as i was used to sit beside joe whenever i entered that place of\\nresort i said â\\x80\\x9cno thank you sirâ\\x80\\x9d and fell into the space joe made\\nfor me on the opposite settle the strange man after glancing at joe\\nand seeing that his attention was otherwise engaged nodded to me again\\nwhen i had taken my seat and then rubbed his legâ\\x80\\x94in a very odd way as\\nit struck me\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou was sayingâ\\x80\\x9d said the strange man turning to joe â\\x80\\x9cthat you was a\\nblacksmithâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyes i said it you knowâ\\x80\\x9d said joe\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhatâ\\x80\\x99ll you drink mrâ\\x80\\x94 you didnâ\\x80\\x99t mention your name by the byeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\njoe mentioned it now and the strange man called him by it â\\x80\\x9cwhatâ\\x80\\x99ll\\nyou drink mr gargery at my expense to top up withâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwellâ\\x80\\x9d said joe â\\x80\\x9cto tell you the truth i ainâ\\x80\\x99t much in the habit of\\ndrinking at anybodyâ\\x80\\x99s expense but my ownâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9chabit noâ\\x80\\x9d returned the stranger â\\x80\\x9cbut once and away and on a\\nsaturday night too come put a name to it mr gargeryâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t wish to be stiff companyâ\\x80\\x9d said joe â\\x80\\x9crumâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9crumâ\\x80\\x9d repeated the stranger â\\x80\\x9cand will the other gentleman originate a\\nsentimentâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9crumâ\\x80\\x9d said mr wopsle\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthree rumsâ\\x80\\x9d cried the stranger calling to the landlord â\\x80\\x9cglasses\\nroundâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthis other gentlemanâ\\x80\\x9d observed joe by way of introducing mr wopsle\\nâ\\x80\\x9cis a gentleman that you would like to hear give it out our clerk at\\nchurchâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cahaâ\\x80\\x9d said the stranger quickly and cocking his eye at me â\\x80\\x9cthe\\nlonely church right out on the marshes with graves round itâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthatâ\\x80\\x99s itâ\\x80\\x9d said joe\\n\\nthe stranger with a comfortable kind of grunt over his pipe put his\\nlegs up on the settle that he had to himself he wore a flapping\\nbroadbrimmed travellerâ\\x80\\x99s hat and under it a handkerchief tied over\\nhis head in the manner of a cap so that he showed no hair as he\\nlooked at the fire i thought i saw a cunning expression followed by a\\nhalflaugh come into his face\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci am not acquainted with this country gentlemen but it seems a\\nsolitary country towards the riverâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmost marshes is solitaryâ\\x80\\x9d said joe\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cno doubt no doubt do you find any gypsies now or tramps or\\nvagrants of any sort out thereâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnoâ\\x80\\x9d said joe â\\x80\\x9cnone but a runaway convict now and then and we donâ\\x80\\x99t\\nfind them easy eh mr wopsleâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nmr wopsle with a majestic remembrance of old discomfiture assented\\nbut not warmly\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cseems you have been out after suchâ\\x80\\x9d asked the stranger\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9conceâ\\x80\\x9d returned joe â\\x80\\x9cnot that we wanted to take them you understand\\nwe went out as lookers on me and mr wopsle and pip didnâ\\x80\\x99t us\\npipâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyes joeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthe stranger looked at me againâ\\x80\\x94still cocking his eye as if he were\\nexpressly taking aim at me with his invisible gunâ\\x80\\x94and said â\\x80\\x9cheâ\\x80\\x99s a\\nlikely young parcel of bones that what is it you call himâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cpipâ\\x80\\x9d said joe\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cchristened pipâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cno not christened pipâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9csurname pipâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnoâ\\x80\\x9d said joe â\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s a kind of family name what he gave himself when a\\ninfant and is called byâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cson of yoursâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwellâ\\x80\\x9d said joe meditatively not of course that it could be in\\nanywise necessary to consider about it but because it was the way at\\nthe jolly bargemen to seem to consider deeply about everything that was\\ndiscussed over pipesâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cwellâ\\x80\\x94no no he ainâ\\x80\\x99tâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnevvyâ\\x80\\x9d said the strange man\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwellâ\\x80\\x9d said joe with the same appearance of profound cogitation â\\x80\\x9che\\nis notâ\\x80\\x94no not to deceive you he is notâ\\x80\\x94my nevvyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhat the blue blazes is heâ\\x80\\x9d asked the stranger which appeared to me\\nto be an inquiry of unnecessary strength\\n\\nmr wopsle struck in upon that as one who knew all about\\nrelationships having professional occasion to bear in mind what female\\nrelations a man might not marry and expounded the ties between me and\\njoe having his hand in mr wopsle finished off with a most\\nterrifically snarling passage from richard the third and seemed to\\nthink he had done quite enough to account for it when he added â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x94as\\nthe poet saysâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nand here i may remark that when mr wopsle referred to me he\\nconsidered it a necessary part of such reference to rumple my hair and\\npoke it into my eyes i cannot conceive why everybody of his standing\\nwho visited at our house should always have put me through the same\\ninflammatory process under similar circumstances yet i do not call to\\nmind that i was ever in my earlier youth the subject of remark in our\\nsocial family circle but some largehanded person took some such\\nophthalmic steps to patronise me\\n\\nall this while the strange man looked at nobody but me and looked at\\nme as if he were determined to have a shot at me at last and bring me\\ndown but he said nothing after offering his blue blazes observation\\nuntil the glasses of rum and water were brought and then he made his\\nshot and a most extraordinary shot it was\\n\\nit was not a verbal remark but a proceeding in dumbshow and was\\npointedly addressed to me he stirred his rum and water pointedly at\\nme and he tasted his rum and water pointedly at me and he stirred it\\nand he tasted it not with a spoon that was brought to him but with a\\nfile\\n\\nhe did this so that nobody but i saw the file and when he had done it\\nhe wiped the file and put it in a breastpocket i knew it to be joeâ\\x80\\x99s\\nfile and i knew that he knew my convict the moment i saw the\\ninstrument i sat gazing at him spellbound but he now reclined on\\nhis settle taking very little notice of me and talking principally\\nabout turnips\\n\\nthere was a delicious sense of cleaningup and making a quiet pause\\nbefore going on in life afresh in our village on saturday nights\\nwhich stimulated joe to dare to stay out half an hour longer on\\nsaturdays than at other times the halfhour and the rum and water\\nrunning out together joe got up to go and took me by the hand\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cstop half a moment mr gargeryâ\\x80\\x9d said the strange man â\\x80\\x9ci think iâ\\x80\\x99ve\\ngot a bright new shilling somewhere in my pocket and if i have the\\nboy shall have itâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nhe looked it out from a handful of small change folded it in some\\ncrumpled paper and gave it to me â\\x80\\x9cyoursâ\\x80\\x9d said he â\\x80\\x9cmind your ownâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni thanked him staring at him far beyond the bounds of good manners\\nand holding tight to joe he gave joe goodnight and he gave mr\\nwopsle goodnight who went out with us and he gave me only a look\\nwith his aiming eyeâ\\x80\\x94no not a look for he shut it up but wonders may\\nbe done with an eye by hiding it\\n\\non the way home if i had been in a humour for talking the talk must\\nhave been all on my side for mr wopsle parted from us at the door of\\nthe jolly bargemen and joe went all the way home with his mouth wide\\nopen to rinse the rum out with as much air as possible but i was in a\\nmanner stupefied by this turning up of my old misdeed and old\\nacquaintance and could think of nothing else\\n\\nmy sister was not in a very bad temper when we presented ourselves in\\nthe kitchen and joe was encouraged by that unusual circumstance to\\ntell her about the bright shilling â\\x80\\x9ca bad un iâ\\x80\\x99ll be boundâ\\x80\\x9d said\\nmrs joe triumphantly â\\x80\\x9cor he wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t have given it to the boy letâ\\x80\\x99s\\nlook at itâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni took it out of the paper and it proved to be a good one â\\x80\\x9cbut whatâ\\x80\\x99s\\nthisâ\\x80\\x9d said mrs joe throwing down the shilling and catching up the\\npaper â\\x80\\x9ctwo onepound notesâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nnothing less than two fat sweltering onepound notes that seemed to\\nhave been on terms of the warmest intimacy with all the cattlemarkets\\nin the county joe caught up his hat again and ran with them to the\\njolly bargemen to restore them to their owner while he was gone i sat\\ndown on my usual stool and looked vacantly at my sister feeling pretty\\nsure that the man would not be there\\n\\npresently joe came back saying that the man was gone but that he\\njoe had left word at the three jolly bargemen concerning the notes\\nthen my sister sealed them up in a piece of paper and put them under\\nsome dried roseleaves in an ornamental teapot on the top of a press in\\nthe state parlour there they remained a nightmare to me many and\\nmany a night and day\\n\\ni had sadly broken sleep when i got to bed through thinking of the\\nstrange man taking aim at me with his invisible gun and of the\\nguiltily coarse and common thing it was to be on secret terms of\\nconspiracy with convictsâ\\x80\\x94a feature in my low career that i had\\npreviously forgotten i was haunted by the file too a dread possessed\\nme that when i least expected it the file would reappear i coaxed\\nmyself to sleep by thinking of miss havishamâ\\x80\\x99s next wednesday and in\\nmy sleep i saw the file coming at me out of a door without seeing who\\nheld it and i screamed myself awake\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter xi\\n\\n\\nat the appointed time i returned to miss havishamâ\\x80\\x99s and my hesitating\\nring at the gate brought out estella she locked it after admitting me\\nas she had done before and again preceded me into the dark passage\\nwhere her candle stood she took no notice of me until she had the\\ncandle in her hand when she looked over her shoulder superciliously\\nsaying â\\x80\\x9cyou are to come this way todayâ\\x80\\x9d and took me to quite another\\npart of the house\\n\\nthe passage was a long one and seemed to pervade the whole square\\nbasement of the manor house we traversed but one side of the square\\nhowever and at the end of it she stopped and put her candle down and\\nopened a door here the daylight reappeared and i found myself in a\\nsmall paved courtyard the opposite side of which was formed by a\\ndetached dwellinghouse that looked as if it had once belonged to the\\nmanager or head clerk of the extinct brewery there was a clock in the\\nouter wall of this house like the clock in miss havishamâ\\x80\\x99s room and\\nlike miss havishamâ\\x80\\x99s watch it had stopped at twenty minutes to nine\\n\\nwe went in at the door which stood open and into a gloomy room with a\\nlow ceiling on the groundfloor at the back there was some company in\\nthe room and estella said to me as she joined it â\\x80\\x9cyou are to go and\\nstand there boy till you are wantedâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cthereâ\\x80\\x9d being the window i\\ncrossed to it and stood â\\x80\\x9cthereâ\\x80\\x9d in a very uncomfortable state of\\nmind looking out\\n\\nit opened to the ground and looked into a most miserable corner of the\\nneglected garden upon a rank ruin of cabbagestalks and one boxtree\\nthat had been clipped round long ago like a pudding and had a new\\ngrowth at the top of it out of shape and of a different colour as if\\nthat part of the pudding had stuck to the saucepan and got burnt this\\nwas my homely thought as i contemplated the boxtree there had been\\nsome light snow overnight and it lay nowhere else to my knowledge\\nbut it had not quite melted from the cold shadow of this bit of\\ngarden and the wind caught it up in little eddies and threw it at the\\nwindow as if it pelted me for coming there\\n\\ni divined that my coming had stopped conversation in the room and that\\nits other occupants were looking at me i could see nothing of the room\\nexcept the shining of the fire in the windowglass but i stiffened in\\nall my joints with the consciousness that i was under close inspection\\n\\nthere were three ladies in the room and one gentleman before i had\\nbeen standing at the window five minutes they somehow conveyed to me\\nthat they were all toadies and humbugs but that each of them pretended\\nnot to know that the others were toadies and humbugs because the\\nadmission that he or she did know it would have made him or her out to\\nbe a toady and humbug\\n\\nthey all had a listless and dreary air of waiting somebodyâ\\x80\\x99s pleasure\\nand the most talkative of the ladies had to speak quite rigidly to\\nrepress a yawn this lady whose name was camilla very much reminded\\nme of my sister with the difference that she was older and as i\\nfound when i caught sight of her of a blunter cast of features\\nindeed when i knew her better i began to think it was a mercy she had\\nany features at all so very blank and high was the dead wall of her\\nface\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cpoor dear soulâ\\x80\\x9d said this lady with an abruptness of manner quite my\\nsisterâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x9cnobodyâ\\x80\\x99s enemy but his ownâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cit would be much more commendable to be somebody elseâ\\x80\\x99s enemyâ\\x80\\x9d said\\nthe gentleman â\\x80\\x9cfar more naturalâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ccousin raymondâ\\x80\\x9d observed another lady â\\x80\\x9cwe are to love our\\nneighbourâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9csarah pocketâ\\x80\\x9d returned cousin raymond â\\x80\\x9cif a man is not his own\\nneighbour who isâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nmiss pocket laughed and camilla laughed and said checking a yawn\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthe ideaâ\\x80\\x9d but i thought they seemed to think it rather a good idea\\ntoo the other lady who had not spoken yet said gravely and\\nemphatically â\\x80\\x9cvery trueâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cpoor soulâ\\x80\\x9d camilla presently went on i knew they had all been\\nlooking at me in the mean time â\\x80\\x9che is so very strange would anyone\\nbelieve that when tomâ\\x80\\x99s wife died he actually could not be induced to\\nsee the importance of the childrenâ\\x80\\x99s having the deepest of trimmings to\\ntheir mourning â\\x80\\x98good lordâ\\x80\\x99 says he â\\x80\\x98camilla what can it signify so\\nlong as the poor bereaved little things are in blackâ\\x80\\x99 so like matthew\\nthe ideaâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cgood points in him good points in himâ\\x80\\x9d said cousin raymond â\\x80\\x9cheaven\\nforbid i should deny good points in him but he never had and he never\\nwill have any sense of the proprietiesâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou know i was obligedâ\\x80\\x9d said camillaâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9ci was obliged to be firm i\\nsaid â\\x80\\x98it will not do for the credit of the familyâ\\x80\\x99 i told him that\\nwithout deep trimmings the family was disgraced i cried about it from\\nbreakfast till dinner i injured my digestion and at last he flung out\\nin his violent way and said with a d â\\x80\\x98then do as you likeâ\\x80\\x99 thank\\ngoodness it will always be a consolation to me to know that i instantly\\nwent out in a pouring rain and bought the thingsâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9che paid for them did he notâ\\x80\\x9d asked estella\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s not the question my dear child who paid for themâ\\x80\\x9d returned\\ncamilla â\\x80\\x9ci bought them and i shall often think of that with peace\\nwhen i wake up in the nightâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthe ringing of a distant bell combined with the echoing of some cry or\\ncall along the passage by which i had come interrupted the\\nconversation and caused estella to say to me â\\x80\\x9cnow boyâ\\x80\\x9d on my turning\\nround they all looked at me with the utmost contempt and as i went\\nout i heard sarah pocket say â\\x80\\x9cwell i am sure what nextâ\\x80\\x9d and camilla\\nadd with indignation â\\x80\\x9cwas there ever such a fancy the ideaâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nas we were going with our candle along the dark passage estella\\nstopped all of a sudden and facing round said in her taunting\\nmanner with her face quite close to mineâ\\x80\\x94\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwellâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwell missâ\\x80\\x9d i answered almost falling over her and checking myself\\n\\nshe stood looking at me and of course i stood looking at her\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cam i prettyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyes i think you are very prettyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cam i insultingâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnot so much so as you were last timeâ\\x80\\x9d said i\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnot so much soâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnoâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nshe fired when she asked the last question and she slapped my face\\nwith such force as she had when i answered it\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnowâ\\x80\\x9d said she â\\x80\\x9cyou little coarse monster what do you think of me\\nnowâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci shall not tell youâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbecause you are going to tell upstairs is that itâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnoâ\\x80\\x9d said i â\\x80\\x9cthatâ\\x80\\x99s not itâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhy donâ\\x80\\x99t you cry again you little wretchâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbecause iâ\\x80\\x99ll never cry for you againâ\\x80\\x9d said i which was i suppose\\nas false a declaration as ever was made for i was inwardly crying for\\nher then and i know what i know of the pain she cost me afterwards\\n\\nwe went on our way upstairs after this episode and as we were going\\nup we met a gentleman groping his way down\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhom have we hereâ\\x80\\x9d asked the gentleman stopping and looking at me\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ca boyâ\\x80\\x9d said estella\\n\\nhe was a burly man of an exceedingly dark complexion with an\\nexceedingly large head and a corresponding large hand he took my chin\\nin his large hand and turned up my face to have a look at me by the\\nlight of the candle he was prematurely bald on the top of his head\\nand had bushy black eyebrows that wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t lie down but stood up\\nbristling his eyes were set very deep in his head and were\\ndisagreeably sharp and suspicious he had a large watchchain and\\nstrong black dots where his beard and whiskers would have been if he\\nhad let them he was nothing to me and i could have had no foresight\\nthen that he ever would be anything to me but it happened that i had\\nthis opportunity of observing him well\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cboy of the neighbourhood heyâ\\x80\\x9d said he\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyes sirâ\\x80\\x9d said i\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9chow do you come hereâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmiss havisham sent for me sirâ\\x80\\x9d i explained\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwell behave yourself i have a pretty large experience of boys and\\nyouâ\\x80\\x99re a bad set of fellows now mindâ\\x80\\x9d said he biting the side of his\\ngreat forefinger as he frowned at me â\\x80\\x9cyou behave yourselfâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nwith those words he released meâ\\x80\\x94which i was glad of for his hand\\nsmelt of scented soapâ\\x80\\x94and went his way downstairs i wondered whether\\nhe could be a doctor but no i thought he couldnâ\\x80\\x99t be a doctor or he\\nwould have a quieter and more persuasive manner there was not much\\ntime to consider the subject for we were soon in miss havishamâ\\x80\\x99s room\\nwhere she and everything else were just as i had left them estella\\nleft me standing near the door and i stood there until miss havisham\\ncast her eyes upon me from the dressingtable\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9csoâ\\x80\\x9d she said without being startled or surprised â\\x80\\x9cthe days have\\nworn away have theyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyes maâ\\x80\\x99am today isâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthere there thereâ\\x80\\x9d with the impatient movement of her fingers â\\x80\\x9ci\\ndonâ\\x80\\x99t want to know are you ready to playâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni was obliged to answer in some confusion â\\x80\\x9ci donâ\\x80\\x99t think i am maâ\\x80\\x99amâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnot at cards againâ\\x80\\x9d she demanded with a searching look\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyes maâ\\x80\\x99am i could do that if i was wantedâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9csince this house strikes you old and grave boyâ\\x80\\x9d said miss havisham\\nimpatiently â\\x80\\x9cand you are unwilling to play are you willing to workâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni could answer this inquiry with a better heart than i had been able to\\nfind for the other question and i said i was quite willing\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthen go into that opposite roomâ\\x80\\x9d said she pointing at the door\\nbehind me with her withered hand â\\x80\\x9cand wait there till i comeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni crossed the staircase landing and entered the room she indicated\\nfrom that room too the daylight was completely excluded and it had\\nan airless smell that was oppressive a fire had been lately kindled in\\nthe damp oldfashioned grate and it was more disposed to go out than\\nto burn up and the reluctant smoke which hung in the room seemed\\ncolder than the clearer airâ\\x80\\x94like our own marsh mist certain wintry\\nbranches of candles on the high chimneypiece faintly lighted the\\nchamber or it would be more expressive to say faintly troubled its\\ndarkness it was spacious and i dare say had once been handsome but\\nevery discernible thing in it was covered with dust and mould and\\ndropping to pieces the most prominent object was a long table with a\\ntablecloth spread on it as if a feast had been in preparation when the\\nhouse and the clocks all stopped together an epergne or centrepiece\\nof some kind was in the middle of this cloth it was so heavily\\noverhung with cobwebs that its form was quite undistinguishable and\\nas i looked along the yellow expanse out of which i remember its\\nseeming to grow like a black fungus i saw specklelegged spiders with\\nblotchy bodies running home to it and running out from it as if some\\ncircumstances of the greatest public importance had just transpired in\\nthe spider community\\n\\ni heard the mice too rattling behind the panels as if the same\\noccurrence were important to their interests but the black beetles\\ntook no notice of the agitation and groped about the hearth in a\\nponderous elderly way as if they were shortsighted and hard of\\nhearing and not on terms with one another\\n\\nthese crawling things had fascinated my attention and i was watching\\nthem from a distance when miss havisham laid a hand upon my shoulder\\nin her other hand she had a crutchheaded stick on which she leaned\\nand she looked like the witch of the place\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthisâ\\x80\\x9d said she pointing to the long table with her stick â\\x80\\x9cis where\\ni will be laid when i am dead they shall come and look at me hereâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nwith some vague misgiving that she might get upon the table then and\\nthere and die at once the complete realisation of the ghastly waxwork\\nat the fair i shrank under her touch\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhat do you think that isâ\\x80\\x9d she asked me again pointing with her\\nstick â\\x80\\x9cthat where those cobwebs areâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci canâ\\x80\\x99t guess what it is maâ\\x80\\x99amâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s a great cake a bridecake mineâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nshe looked all round the room in a glaring manner and then said\\nleaning on me while her hand twitched my shoulder â\\x80\\x9ccome come come\\nwalk me walk meâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni made out from this that the work i had to do was to walk miss\\nhavisham round and round the room accordingly i started at once and\\nshe leaned upon my shoulder and we went away at a pace that might have\\nbeen an imitation founded on my first impulse under that roof of mr\\npumblechookâ\\x80\\x99s chaisecart\\n\\nshe was not physically strong and after a little time said â\\x80\\x9cslowerâ\\x80\\x9d\\nstill we went at an impatient fitful speed and as we went she\\ntwitched the hand upon my shoulder and worked her mouth and led me to\\nbelieve that we were going fast because her thoughts went fast after a\\nwhile she said â\\x80\\x9ccall estellaâ\\x80\\x9d so i went out on the landing and roared\\nthat name as i had done on the previous occasion when her light\\nappeared i returned to miss havisham and we started away again round\\nand round the room\\n\\nif only estella had come to be a spectator of our proceedings i should\\nhave felt sufficiently discontented but as she brought with her the\\nthree ladies and the gentleman whom i had seen below i didnâ\\x80\\x99t know\\nwhat to do in my politeness i would have stopped but miss havisham\\ntwitched my shoulder and we posted onâ\\x80\\x94with a shamefaced\\nconsciousness on my part that they would think it was all my doing\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cdear miss havishamâ\\x80\\x9d said miss sarah pocket â\\x80\\x9chow well you lookâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci do notâ\\x80\\x9d returned miss havisham â\\x80\\x9ci am yellow skin and boneâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ncamilla brightened when miss pocket met with this rebuff and she\\nmurmured as she plaintively contemplated miss havisham â\\x80\\x9cpoor dear\\nsoul certainly not to be expected to look well poor thing the ideaâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cand how are youâ\\x80\\x9d said miss havisham to camilla as we were close to\\ncamilla then i would have stopped as a matter of course only miss\\nhavisham wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t stop we swept on and i felt that i was highly\\nobnoxious to camilla\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthank you miss havishamâ\\x80\\x9d she returned â\\x80\\x9ci am as well as can be\\nexpectedâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhy whatâ\\x80\\x99s the matter with youâ\\x80\\x9d asked miss havisham with exceeding\\nsharpness\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnothing worth mentioningâ\\x80\\x9d replied camilla â\\x80\\x9ci donâ\\x80\\x99t wish to make a\\ndisplay of my feelings but i have habitually thought of you more in\\nthe night than i am quite equal toâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthen donâ\\x80\\x99t think of meâ\\x80\\x9d retorted miss havisham\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cvery easily saidâ\\x80\\x9d remarked camilla amiably repressing a sob while a\\nhitch came into her upper lip and her tears overflowed â\\x80\\x9craymond is a\\nwitness what ginger and sal volatile i am obliged to take in the night\\nraymond is a witness what nervous jerkings i have in my legs chokings\\nand nervous jerkings however are nothing new to me when i think with\\nanxiety of those i love if i could be less affectionate and sensitive\\ni should have a better digestion and an iron set of nerves i am sure i\\nwish it could be so but as to not thinking of you in the nightâ\\x80\\x94the\\nideaâ\\x80\\x9d here a burst of tears\\n\\nthe raymond referred to i understood to be the gentleman present and\\nhim i understood to be mr camilla he came to the rescue at this\\npoint and said in a consolatory and complimentary voice â\\x80\\x9ccamilla my\\ndear it is well known that your family feelings are gradually\\nundermining you to the extent of making one of your legs shorter than\\nthe otherâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci am not awareâ\\x80\\x9d observed the grave lady whose voice i had heard but\\nonce â\\x80\\x9cthat to think of any person is to make a great claim upon that\\nperson my dearâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nmiss sarah pocket whom i now saw to be a little dry brown corrugated\\nold woman with a small face that might have been made of\\nwalnutshells and a large mouth like a catâ\\x80\\x99s without the whiskers\\nsupported this position by saying â\\x80\\x9cno indeed my dear hemâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthinking is easy enoughâ\\x80\\x9d said the grave lady\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhat is easier you knowâ\\x80\\x9d assented miss sarah pocket\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9coh yes yesâ\\x80\\x9d cried camilla whose fermenting feelings appeared to\\nrise from her legs to her bosom â\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s all very true itâ\\x80\\x99s a weakness\\nto be so affectionate but i canâ\\x80\\x99t help it no doubt my health would be\\nmuch better if it was otherwise still i wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t change my disposition\\nif i could itâ\\x80\\x99s the cause of much suffering but itâ\\x80\\x99s a consolation to\\nknow i posses it when i wake up in the nightâ\\x80\\x9d here another burst of\\nfeeling\\n\\nmiss havisham and i had never stopped all this time but kept going\\nround and round the room now brushing against the skirts of the\\nvisitors now giving them the whole length of the dismal chamber\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthereâ\\x80\\x99s matthewâ\\x80\\x9d said camilla â\\x80\\x9cnever mixing with any natural ties\\nnever coming here to see how miss havisham is i have taken to the sofa\\nwith my staylace cut and have lain there hours insensible with my\\nhead over the side and my hair all down and my feet i donâ\\x80\\x99t know\\nwhereâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmuch higher than your head my loveâ\\x80\\x9d said mr camilla\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci have gone off into that state hours and hours on account of\\nmatthewâ\\x80\\x99s strange and inexplicable conduct and nobody has thanked meâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9creally i must say i should think notâ\\x80\\x9d interposed the grave lady\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou see my dearâ\\x80\\x9d added miss sarah pocket a blandly vicious\\npersonage â\\x80\\x9cthe question to put to yourself is who did you expect to\\nthank you my loveâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwithout expecting any thanks or anything of the sortâ\\x80\\x9d resumed\\ncamilla â\\x80\\x9ci have remained in that state hours and hours and raymond\\nis a witness of the extent to which i have choked and what the total\\ninefficacy of ginger has been and i have been heard at the pianoforte\\ntunerâ\\x80\\x99s across the street where the poor mistaken children have even\\nsupposed it to be pigeons cooing at a distanceâ\\x80\\x94and now to be toldâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\nhere camilla put her hand to her throat and began to be quite chemical\\nas to the formation of new combinations there\\n\\nwhen this same matthew was mentioned miss havisham stopped me and\\nherself and stood looking at the speaker this change had a great\\ninfluence in bringing camillaâ\\x80\\x99s chemistry to a sudden end\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmatthew will come and see me at lastâ\\x80\\x9d said miss havisham sternly\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhen i am laid on that table that will be his placeâ\\x80\\x94thereâ\\x80\\x9d striking\\nthe table with her stick â\\x80\\x9cat my head and yours will be there and\\nyour husbandâ\\x80\\x99s there and sarah pocketâ\\x80\\x99s there and georgianaâ\\x80\\x99s there\\nnow you all know where to take your stations when you come to feast\\nupon me and now goâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nat the mention of each name she had struck the table with her stick in\\na new place she now said â\\x80\\x9cwalk me walk meâ\\x80\\x9d and we went on again\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci suppose thereâ\\x80\\x99s nothing to be doneâ\\x80\\x9d exclaimed camilla â\\x80\\x9cbut comply\\nand depart itâ\\x80\\x99s something to have seen the object of oneâ\\x80\\x99s love and\\nduty for even so short a time i shall think of it with a melancholy\\nsatisfaction when i wake up in the night i wish matthew could have\\nthat comfort but he sets it at defiance i am determined not to make a\\ndisplay of my feelings but itâ\\x80\\x99s very hard to be told one wants to\\nfeast on oneâ\\x80\\x99s relationsâ\\x80\\x94as if one was a giantâ\\x80\\x94and to be told to go\\nthe bare ideaâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nmr camilla interposing as mrs camilla laid her hand upon her heaving\\nbosom that lady assumed an unnatural fortitude of manner which i\\nsupposed to be expressive of an intention to drop and choke when out of\\nview and kissing her hand to miss havisham was escorted forth sarah\\npocket and georgiana contended who should remain last but sarah was\\ntoo knowing to be outdone and ambled round georgiana with that artful\\nslipperiness that the latter was obliged to take precedence sarah\\npocket then made her separate effect of departing with â\\x80\\x9cbless you\\nmiss havisham dearâ\\x80\\x9d and with a smile of forgiving pity on her\\nwalnutshell countenance for the weaknesses of the rest\\n\\nwhile estella was away lighting them down miss havisham still walked\\nwith her hand on my shoulder but more and more slowly at last she\\nstopped before the fire and said after muttering and looking at it\\nsome secondsâ\\x80\\x94\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthis is my birthday pipâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni was going to wish her many happy returns when she lifted her stick\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci donâ\\x80\\x99t suffer it to be spoken of i donâ\\x80\\x99t suffer those who were here\\njust now or any one to speak of it they come here on the day but\\nthey dare not refer to itâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nof course i made no further effort to refer to it\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9con this day of the year long before you were born this heap of\\ndecayâ\\x80\\x9d stabbing with her crutched stick at the pile of cobwebs on the\\ntable but not touching it â\\x80\\x9cwas brought here it and i have worn away\\ntogether the mice have gnawed at it and sharper teeth than teeth of\\nmice have gnawed at meâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nshe held the head of her stick against her heart as she stood looking\\nat the table she in her once white dress all yellow and withered the\\nonce white cloth all yellow and withered everything around in a state\\nto crumble under a touch\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhen the ruin is completeâ\\x80\\x9d said she with a ghastly look â\\x80\\x9cand when\\nthey lay me dead in my brideâ\\x80\\x99s dress on the brideâ\\x80\\x99s tableâ\\x80\\x94which shall\\nbe done and which will be the finished curse upon himâ\\x80\\x94so much the\\nbetter if it is done on this dayâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nshe stood looking at the table as if she stood looking at her own\\nfigure lying there i remained quiet estella returned and she too\\nremained quiet it seemed to me that we continued thus for a long time\\nin the heavy air of the room and the heavy darkness that brooded in\\nits remoter corners i even had an alarming fancy that estella and i\\nmight presently begin to decay\\n\\nat length not coming out of her distraught state by degrees but in an\\ninstant miss havisham said â\\x80\\x9clet me see you two play cards why have\\nyou not begunâ\\x80\\x9d with that we returned to her room and sat down as\\nbefore i was beggared as before and again as before miss havisham\\nwatched us all the time directed my attention to estellaâ\\x80\\x99s beauty and\\nmade me notice it the more by trying her jewels on estellaâ\\x80\\x99s breast and\\nhair\\n\\nestella for her part likewise treated me as before except that she\\ndid not condescend to speak when we had played some halfdozen games\\na day was appointed for my return and i was taken down into the yard\\nto be fed in the former doglike manner there too i was again left\\nto wander about as i liked\\n\\nit is not much to the purpose whether a gate in that garden wall which\\ni had scrambled up to peep over on the last occasion was on that last\\noccasion open or shut enough that i saw no gate then and that i saw\\none now as it stood open and as i knew that estella had let the\\nvisitors outâ\\x80\\x94for she had returned with the keys in her handâ\\x80\\x94i\\nstrolled into the garden and strolled all over it it was quite a\\nwilderness and there were old melonframes and cucumberframes in it\\nwhich seemed in their decline to have produced a spontaneous growth of\\nweak attempts at pieces of old hats and boots with now and then a\\nweedy offshoot into the likeness of a battered saucepan\\n\\nwhen i had exhausted the garden and a greenhouse with nothing in it but\\na fallendown grapevine and some bottles i found myself in the dismal\\ncorner upon which i had looked out of the window never questioning for\\na moment that the house was now empty i looked in at another window\\nand found myself to my great surprise exchanging a broad stare with a\\npale young gentleman with red eyelids and light hair\\n\\nthis pale young gentleman quickly disappeared and reappeared beside\\nme he had been at his books when i had found myself staring at him\\nand i now saw that he was inky\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9challoaâ\\x80\\x9d said he â\\x80\\x9cyoung fellowâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nhalloa being a general observation which i had usually observed to be\\nbest answered by itself i said â\\x80\\x9challoaâ\\x80\\x9d politely omitting young\\nfellow\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwho let you inâ\\x80\\x9d said he\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmiss estellaâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwho gave you leave to prowl aboutâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmiss estellaâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ccome and fightâ\\x80\\x9d said the pale young gentleman\\n\\nwhat could i do but follow him i have often asked myself the question\\nsince but what else could i do his manner was so final and i was so\\nastonished that i followed where he led as if i had been under a\\nspell\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cstop a minute thoughâ\\x80\\x9d he said wheeling round before we had gone\\nmany paces â\\x80\\x9ci ought to give you a reason for fighting too there it\\nisâ\\x80\\x9d in a most irritating manner he instantly slapped his hands against\\none another daintily flung one of his legs up behind him pulled my\\nhair slapped his hands again dipped his head and butted it into my\\nstomach\\n\\nthe bulllike proceeding last mentioned besides that it was\\nunquestionably to be regarded in the light of a liberty was\\nparticularly disagreeable just after bread and meat i therefore hit\\nout at him and was going to hit out again when he said â\\x80\\x9caha would\\nyouâ\\x80\\x9d and began dancing backwards and forwards in a manner quite\\nunparalleled within my limited experience\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9claws of the gameâ\\x80\\x9d said he here he skipped from his left leg on to\\nhis right â\\x80\\x9cregular rulesâ\\x80\\x9d here he skipped from his right leg on to\\nhis left â\\x80\\x9ccome to the ground and go through the preliminariesâ\\x80\\x9d here\\nhe dodged backwards and forwards and did all sorts of things while i\\nlooked helplessly at him\\n\\ni was secretly afraid of him when i saw him so dexterous but i felt\\nmorally and physically convinced that his light head of hair could have\\nhad no business in the pit of my stomach and that i had a right to\\nconsider it irrelevant when so obtruded on my attention therefore i\\nfollowed him without a word to a retired nook of the garden formed by\\nthe junction of two walls and screened by some rubbish on his asking\\nme if i was satisfied with the ground and on my replying yes he\\nbegged my leave to absent himself for a moment and quickly returned\\nwith a bottle of water and a sponge dipped in vinegar â\\x80\\x9cavailable for\\nbothâ\\x80\\x9d he said placing these against the wall and then fell to\\npulling off not only his jacket and waistcoat but his shirt too in a\\nmanner at once lighthearted businesslike and bloodthirsty\\n\\nalthough he did not look very healthyâ\\x80\\x94having pimples on his face and\\na breaking out at his mouthâ\\x80\\x94these dreadful preparations quite appalled\\nme i judged him to be about my own age but he was much taller and he\\nhad a way of spinning himself about that was full of appearance for\\nthe rest he was a young gentleman in a grey suit when not denuded for\\nbattle with his elbows knees wrists and heels considerably in\\nadvance of the rest of him as to development\\n\\nmy heart failed me when i saw him squaring at me with every\\ndemonstration of mechanical nicety and eyeing my anatomy as if he were\\nminutely choosing his bone i never have been so surprised in my life\\nas i was when i let out the first blow and saw him lying on his back\\nlooking up at me with a bloody nose and his face exceedingly\\nforeshortened\\n\\nbut he was on his feet directly and after sponging himself with a\\ngreat show of dexterity began squaring again the second greatest\\nsurprise i have ever had in my life was seeing him on his back again\\nlooking up at me out of a black eye\\n\\nhis spirit inspired me with great respect he seemed to have no\\nstrength and he never once hit me hard and he was always knocked\\ndown but he would be up again in a moment sponging himself or\\ndrinking out of the waterbottle with the greatest satisfaction in\\nseconding himself according to form and then came at me with an air\\nand a show that made me believe he really was going to do for me at\\nlast he got heavily bruised for i am sorry to record that the more i\\nhit him the harder i hit him but he came up again and again and\\nagain until at last he got a bad fall with the back of his head\\nagainst the wall even after that crisis in our affairs he got up and\\nturned round and round confusedly a few times not knowing where i was\\nbut finally went on his knees to his sponge and threw it up at the\\nsame time panting out â\\x80\\x9cthat means you have wonâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nhe seemed so brave and innocent that although i had not proposed the\\ncontest i felt but a gloomy satisfaction in my victory indeed i go\\nso far as to hope that i regarded myself while dressing as a species of\\nsavage young wolf or other wild beast however i got dressed darkly\\nwiping my sanguinary face at intervals and i said â\\x80\\x9ccan i help youâ\\x80\\x9d\\nand he said â\\x80\\x9cno thankeeâ\\x80\\x9d and i said â\\x80\\x9cgood afternoonâ\\x80\\x9d and he said\\nâ\\x80\\x9csame to youâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nwhen i got into the courtyard i found estella waiting with the keys\\nbut she neither asked me where i had been nor why i had kept her\\nwaiting and there was a bright flush upon her face as though\\nsomething had happened to delight her instead of going straight to the\\ngate too she stepped back into the passage and beckoned me\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ccome here you may kiss me if you likeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni kissed her cheek as she turned it to me i think i would have gone\\nthrough a great deal to kiss her cheek but i felt that the kiss was\\ngiven to the coarse common boy as a piece of money might have been and\\nthat it was worth nothing\\n\\nwhat with the birthday visitors and what with the cards and what with\\nthe fight my stay had lasted so long that when i neared home the\\nlight on the spit of sand off the point on the marshes was gleaming\\nagainst a black nightsky and joeâ\\x80\\x99s furnace was flinging a path of\\nfire across the road\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter xii\\n\\n\\nmy mind grew very uneasy on the subject of the pale young gentleman\\nthe more i thought of the fight and recalled the pale young gentleman\\non his back in various stages of puffy and incrimsoned countenance the\\nmore certain it appeared that something would be done to me i felt\\nthat the pale young gentlemanâ\\x80\\x99s blood was on my head and that the law\\nwould avenge it without having any definite idea of the penalties i\\nhad incurred it was clear to me that village boys could not go\\nstalking about the country ravaging the houses of gentlefolks and\\npitching into the studious youth of england without laying themselves\\nopen to severe punishment for some days i even kept close at home\\nand looked out at the kitchen door with the greatest caution and\\ntrepidation before going on an errand lest the officers of the county\\njail should pounce upon me the pale young gentlemanâ\\x80\\x99s nose had stained\\nmy trousers and i tried to wash out that evidence of my guilt in the\\ndead of night i had cut my knuckles against the pale young gentlemanâ\\x80\\x99s\\nteeth and i twisted my imagination into a thousand tangles as i\\ndevised incredible ways of accounting for that damnatory circumstance\\nwhen i should be haled before the judges\\n\\nwhen the day came round for my return to the scene of the deed of\\nviolence my terrors reached their height whether myrmidons of\\njustice especially sent down from london would be lying in ambush\\nbehind the gateâ\\x80\\x94whether miss havisham preferring to take personal\\nvengeance for an outrage done to her house might rise in those\\ngraveclothes of hers draw a pistol and shoot me deadâ\\x80\\x94whether\\nsuborned boysâ\\x80\\x94a numerous band of mercenariesâ\\x80\\x94might be engaged to fall\\nupon me in the brewery and cuff me until i was no moreâ\\x80\\x94it was high\\ntestimony to my confidence in the spirit of the pale young gentleman\\nthat i never imagined him accessory to these retaliations they\\nalways came into my mind as the acts of injudicious relatives of his\\ngoaded on by the state of his visage and an indignant sympathy with the\\nfamily features\\n\\nhowever go to miss havishamâ\\x80\\x99s i must and go i did and behold\\nnothing came of the late struggle it was not alluded to in any way\\nand no pale young gentleman was to be discovered on the premises i\\nfound the same gate open and i explored the garden and even looked in\\nat the windows of the detached house but my view was suddenly stopped\\nby the closed shutters within and all was lifeless only in the corner\\nwhere the combat had taken place could i detect any evidence of the\\nyoung gentlemanâ\\x80\\x99s existence there were traces of his gore in that\\nspot and i covered them with gardenmould from the eye of man\\n\\non the broad landing between miss havishamâ\\x80\\x99s own room and that other\\nroom in which the long table was laid out i saw a gardenchairâ\\x80\\x94a\\nlight chair on wheels that you pushed from behind it had been placed\\nthere since my last visit and i entered that same day on a regular\\noccupation of pushing miss havisham in this chair when she was tired\\nof walking with her hand upon my shoulder round her own room and\\nacross the landing and round the other room over and over and over\\nagain we would make these journeys and sometimes they would last as\\nlong as three hours at a stretch i insensibly fall into a general\\nmention of these journeys as numerous because it was at once settled\\nthat i should return every alternate day at noon for these purposes\\nand because i am now going to sum up a period of at least eight or ten\\nmonths\\n\\nas we began to be more used to one another miss havisham talked more\\nto me and asked me such questions as what had i learnt and what was i\\ngoing to be i told her i was going to be apprenticed to joe i\\nbelieved and i enlarged upon my knowing nothing and wanting to know\\neverything in the hope that she might offer some help towards that\\ndesirable end but she did not on the contrary she seemed to prefer\\nmy being ignorant neither did she ever give me any moneyâ\\x80\\x94or anything\\nbut my daily dinnerâ\\x80\\x94nor ever stipulate that i should be paid for my\\nservices\\n\\nestella was always about and always let me in and out but never told\\nme i might kiss her again sometimes she would coldly tolerate me\\nsometimes she would condescend to me sometimes she would be quite\\nfamiliar with me sometimes she would tell me energetically that she\\nhated me miss havisham would often ask me in a whisper or when we\\nwere alone â\\x80\\x9cdoes she grow prettier and prettier pipâ\\x80\\x9d and when i said\\nyes for indeed she did would seem to enjoy it greedily also when\\nwe played at cards miss havisham would look on with a miserly relish\\nof estellaâ\\x80\\x99s moods whatever they were and sometimes when her moods\\nwere so many and so contradictory of one another that i was puzzled\\nwhat to say or do miss havisham would embrace her with lavish\\nfondness murmuring something in her ear that sounded like â\\x80\\x9cbreak their\\nhearts my pride and hope break their hearts and have no mercyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthere was a song joe used to hum fragments of at the forge of which\\nthe burden was old clem this was not a very ceremonious way of\\nrendering homage to a patron saint but i believe old clem stood in\\nthat relation towards smiths it was a song that imitated the measure\\nof beating upon iron and was a mere lyrical excuse for the\\nintroduction of old clemâ\\x80\\x99s respected name thus you were to hammer\\nboys roundâ\\x80\\x94old clem with a thump and a soundâ\\x80\\x94old clem beat it out\\nbeat it outâ\\x80\\x94old clem with a clink for the stoutâ\\x80\\x94old clem blow the\\nfire blow the fireâ\\x80\\x94old clem roaring dryer soaring higherâ\\x80\\x94old clem\\none day soon after the appearance of the chair miss havisham suddenly\\nsaying to me with the impatient movement of her fingers â\\x80\\x9cthere\\nthere there singâ\\x80\\x9d i was surprised into crooning this ditty as i\\npushed her over the floor it happened so to catch her fancy that she\\ntook it up in a low brooding voice as if she were singing in her sleep\\nafter that it became customary with us to have it as we moved about\\nand estella would often join in though the whole strain was so\\nsubdued even when there were three of us that it made less noise in\\nthe grim old house than the lightest breath of wind\\n\\nwhat could i become with these surroundings how could my character\\nfail to be influenced by them is it to be wondered at if my thoughts\\nwere dazed as my eyes were when i came out into the natural light\\nfrom the misty yellow rooms\\n\\nperhaps i might have told joe about the pale young gentleman if i had\\nnot previously been betrayed into those enormous inventions to which i\\nhad confessed under the circumstances i felt that joe could hardly\\nfail to discern in the pale young gentleman an appropriate passenger\\nto be put into the black velvet coach therefore i said nothing of\\nhim besides that shrinking from having miss havisham and estella\\ndiscussed which had come upon me in the beginning grew much more\\npotent as time went on i reposed complete confidence in no one but\\nbiddy but i told poor biddy everything why it came natural to me to\\ndo so and why biddy had a deep concern in everything i told her i did\\nnot know then though i think i know now\\n\\nmeanwhile councils went on in the kitchen at home fraught with almost\\ninsupportable aggravation to my exasperated spirit that ass\\npumblechook used often to come over of a night for the purpose of\\ndiscussing my prospects with my sister and i really do believe to\\nthis hour with less penitence than i ought to feel that if these\\nhands could have taken a linchpin out of his chaisecart they would\\nhave done it the miserable man was a man of that confined stolidity of\\nmind that he could not discuss my prospects without having me before\\nhimâ\\x80\\x94as it were to operate uponâ\\x80\\x94and he would drag me up from my stool\\nusually by the collar where i was quiet in a corner and putting me\\nbefore the fire as if i were going to be cooked would begin by saying\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnow mum here is this boy here is this boy which you brought up by\\nhand hold up your head boy and be forever grateful unto them which\\nso did do now mum with respections to this boyâ\\x80\\x9d and then he would\\nrumple my hair the wrong wayâ\\x80\\x94which from my earliest remembrance as\\nalready hinted i have in my soul denied the right of any\\nfellowcreature to doâ\\x80\\x94and would hold me before him by the sleeveâ\\x80\\x94a\\nspectacle of imbecility only to be equalled by himself\\n\\nthen he and my sister would pair off in such nonsensical speculations\\nabout miss havisham and about what she would do with me and for me\\nthat i used to wantâ\\x80\\x94quite painfullyâ\\x80\\x94to burst into spiteful tears fly\\nat pumblechook and pummel him all over in these dialogues my sister\\nspoke to me as if she were morally wrenching one of my teeth out at\\nevery reference while pumblechook himself selfconstituted my patron\\nwould sit supervising me with a depreciatory eye like the architect of\\nmy fortunes who thought himself engaged on a very unremunerative job\\n\\nin these discussions joe bore no part but he was often talked at\\nwhile they were in progress by reason of mrs joeâ\\x80\\x99s perceiving that he\\nwas not favourable to my being taken from the forge i was fully old\\nenough now to be apprenticed to joe and when joe sat with the poker on\\nhis knees thoughtfully raking out the ashes between the lower bars my\\nsister would so distinctly construe that innocent action into\\nopposition on his part that she would dive at him take the poker out\\nof his hands shake him and put it away there was a most irritating\\nend to every one of these debates all in a moment with nothing to\\nlead up to it my sister would stop herself in a yawn and catching\\nsight of me as it were incidentally would swoop upon me with â\\x80\\x9ccome\\nthereâ\\x80\\x99s enough of you you get along to bed youâ\\x80\\x99ve given trouble\\nenough for one night i hopeâ\\x80\\x9d as if i had besought them as a favour to\\nbother my life out\\n\\nwe went on in this way for a long time and it seemed likely that we\\nshould continue to go on in this way for a long time when one day miss\\nhavisham stopped short as she and i were walking she leaning on my\\nshoulder and said with some displeasureâ\\x80\\x94\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou are growing tall pipâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni thought it best to hint through the medium of a meditative look\\nthat this might be occasioned by circumstances over which i had no\\ncontrol\\n\\nshe said no more at the time but she presently stopped and looked at\\nme again and presently again and after that looked frowning and\\nmoody on the next day of my attendance when our usual exercise was\\nover and i had landed her at her dressingtable she stayed me with a\\nmovement of her impatient fingersâ\\x80\\x94\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ctell me the name again of that blacksmith of yoursâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cjoe gargery maâ\\x80\\x99amâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmeaning the master you were to be apprenticed toâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyes miss havishamâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou had better be apprenticed at once would gargery come here with\\nyou and bring your indentures do you thinkâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni signified that i had no doubt he would take it as an honour to be\\nasked\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthen let him comeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cat any particular time miss havishamâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthere there i know nothing about times let him come soon and come\\nalong with youâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nwhen i got home at night and delivered this message for joe my sister\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwent on the rampageâ\\x80\\x9d in a more alarming degree than at any previous\\nperiod she asked me and joe whether we supposed she was doormats\\nunder our feet and how we dared to use her so and what company we\\ngraciously thought she was fit for when she had exhausted a torrent\\nof such inquiries she threw a candlestick at joe burst into a loud\\nsobbing got out the dustpanâ\\x80\\x94which was always a very bad signâ\\x80\\x94put on\\nher coarse apron and began cleaning up to a terrible extent not\\nsatisfied with a dry cleaning she took to a pail and scrubbingbrush\\nand cleaned us out of house and home so that we stood shivering in the\\nbackyard it was ten oâ\\x80\\x99clock at night before we ventured to creep in\\nagain and then she asked joe why he hadnâ\\x80\\x99t married a negress slave at\\nonce joe offered no answer poor fellow but stood feeling his whisker\\nand looking dejectedly at me as if he thought it really might have\\nbeen a better speculation\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter xiii\\n\\n\\nit was a trial to my feelings on the next day but one to see joe\\narraying himself in his sunday clothes to accompany me to miss\\nhavishamâ\\x80\\x99s however as he thought his courtsuit necessary to the\\noccasion it was not for me to tell him that he looked far better in\\nhis workingdress the rather because i knew he made himself so\\ndreadfully uncomfortable entirely on my account and that it was for\\nme he pulled up his shirtcollar so very high behind that it made the\\nhair on the crown of his head stand up like a tuft of feathers\\n\\nat breakfasttime my sister declared her intention of going to town\\nwith us and being left at uncle pumblechookâ\\x80\\x99s and called for â\\x80\\x9cwhen we\\nhad done with our fine ladiesâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94a way of putting the case from which\\njoe appeared inclined to augur the worst the forge was shut up for the\\nday and joe inscribed in chalk upon the door as it was his custom to\\ndo on the very rare occasions when he was not at work the monosyllable\\nhout accompanied by a sketch of an arrow supposed to be flying in the\\ndirection he had taken\\n\\nwe walked to town my sister leading the way in a very large beaver\\nbonnet and carrying a basket like the great seal of england in plaited\\nstraw a pair of pattens a spare shawl and an umbrella though it was\\na fine bright day i am not quite clear whether these articles were\\ncarried penitentially or ostentatiously but i rather think they were\\ndisplayed as articles of propertyâ\\x80\\x94much as cleopatra or any other\\nsovereign lady on the rampage might exhibit her wealth in a pageant or\\nprocession\\n\\nwhen we came to pumblechookâ\\x80\\x99s my sister bounced in and left us as it\\nwas almost noon joe and i held straight on to miss havishamâ\\x80\\x99s house\\nestella opened the gate as usual and the moment she appeared joe\\ntook his hat off and stood weighing it by the brim in both his hands\\nas if he had some urgent reason in his mind for being particular to\\nhalf a quarter of an ounce\\n\\nestella took no notice of either of us but led us the way that i knew\\nso well i followed next to her and joe came last when i looked back\\nat joe in the long passage he was still weighing his hat with the\\ngreatest care and was coming after us in long strides on the tips of\\nhis toes\\n\\nestella told me we were both to go in so i took joe by the coatcuff\\nand conducted him into miss havishamâ\\x80\\x99s presence she was seated at her\\ndressingtable and looked round at us immediately\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cohâ\\x80\\x9d said she to joe â\\x80\\x9cyou are the husband of the sister of this boyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni could hardly have imagined dear old joe looking so unlike himself or\\nso like some extraordinary bird standing as he did speechless with\\nhis tuft of feathers ruffled and his mouth open as if he wanted a\\nworm\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou are the husbandâ\\x80\\x9d repeated miss havisham â\\x80\\x9cof the sister of this\\nboyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nit was very aggravating but throughout the interview joe persisted\\nin addressing me instead of miss havisham\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhich i meantersay pipâ\\x80\\x9d joe now observed in a manner that was at\\nonce expressive of forcible argumentation strict confidence and great\\npoliteness â\\x80\\x9cas i hup and married your sister and i were at the time\\nwhat you might call if you was anyways inclined a single manâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwellâ\\x80\\x9d said miss havisham â\\x80\\x9cand you have reared the boy with the\\nintention of taking him for your apprentice is that so mr gargeryâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou know pipâ\\x80\\x9d replied joe â\\x80\\x9cas you and me were ever friends and it\\nwere looked forâ\\x80\\x99ard to betwixt us as being calcâ\\x80\\x99lated to lead to\\nlarks not but what pip if you had ever made objections to the\\nbusinessâ\\x80\\x94such as its being open to black and sut or suchlikeâ\\x80\\x94not\\nbut what they would have been attended to donâ\\x80\\x99t you seeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9chas the boyâ\\x80\\x9d said miss havisham â\\x80\\x9cever made any objection does he\\nlike the tradeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhich it is well beknown to yourself pipâ\\x80\\x9d returned joe\\nstrengthening his former mixture of argumentation confidence and\\npoliteness â\\x80\\x9cthat it were the wish of your own hartâ\\x80\\x9d i saw the idea\\nsuddenly break upon him that he would adapt his epitaph to the\\noccasion before he went on to say â\\x80\\x9cand there werenâ\\x80\\x99t no objection on\\nyour part and pip it were the great wish of your hartâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nit was quite in vain for me to endeavour to make him sensible that he\\nought to speak to miss havisham the more i made faces and gestures to\\nhim to do it the more confidential argumentative and polite he\\npersisted in being to me\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9chave you brought his indentures with youâ\\x80\\x9d asked miss havisham\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwell pip you knowâ\\x80\\x9d replied joe as if that were a little\\nunreasonable â\\x80\\x9cyou yourself see me put â\\x80\\x99em in my â\\x80\\x99at and therefore you\\nknow as they are hereâ\\x80\\x9d with which he took them out and gave them not\\nto miss havisham but to me i am afraid i was ashamed of the dear good\\nfellowâ\\x80\\x94i know i was ashamed of himâ\\x80\\x94when i saw that estella stood at\\nthe back of miss havishamâ\\x80\\x99s chair and that her eyes laughed\\nmischievously i took the indentures out of his hand and gave them to\\nmiss havisham\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou expectedâ\\x80\\x9d said miss havisham as she looked them over â\\x80\\x9cno\\npremium with the boyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cjoeâ\\x80\\x9d i remonstrated for he made no reply at all â\\x80\\x9cwhy donâ\\x80\\x99t you\\nanswerâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cpipâ\\x80\\x9d returned joe cutting me short as if he were hurt â\\x80\\x9cwhich i\\nmeantersay that were not a question requiring a answer betwixt yourself\\nand me and which you know the answer to be full well no you know it\\nto be no pip and wherefore should i say itâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nmiss havisham glanced at him as if she understood what he really was\\nbetter than i had thought possible seeing what he was there and took\\nup a little bag from the table beside her\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cpip has earned a premium hereâ\\x80\\x9d she said â\\x80\\x9cand here it is there are\\nfiveandtwenty guineas in this bag give it to your master pipâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nas if he were absolutely out of his mind with the wonder awakened in\\nhim by her strange figure and the strange room joe even at this pass\\npersisted in addressing me\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthis is wery liberal on your part pipâ\\x80\\x9d said joe â\\x80\\x9cand it is as such\\nreceived and grateful welcome though never looked for far nor near\\nnor nowheres and now old chapâ\\x80\\x9d said joe conveying to me a\\nsensation first of burning and then of freezing for i felt as if that\\nfamiliar expression were applied to miss havishamâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cand now old chap\\nmay we do our duty may you and me do our duty both on us by one and\\nanother and by them which your liberal presentâ\\x80\\x94haveconweyedâ\\x80\\x94to beâ\\x80\\x94for\\nthe satisfaction of mindofâ\\x80\\x94them as neverâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d here joe showed that he\\nfelt he had fallen into frightful difficulties until he triumphantly\\nrescued himself with the words â\\x80\\x9cand from myself far be itâ\\x80\\x9d these\\nwords had such a round and convincing sound for him that he said them\\ntwice\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cgoodbye pipâ\\x80\\x9d said miss havisham â\\x80\\x9clet them out estellaâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cam i to come again miss havishamâ\\x80\\x9d i asked\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cno gargery is your master now gargery one wordâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthus calling him back as i went out of the door i heard her say to joe\\nin a distinct emphatic voice â\\x80\\x9cthe boy has been a good boy here and\\nthat is his reward of course as an honest man you will expect no\\nother and no moreâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nhow joe got out of the room i have never been able to determine but i\\nknow that when he did get out he was steadily proceeding upstairs\\ninstead of coming down and was deaf to all remonstrances until i went\\nafter him and laid hold of him in another minute we were outside the\\ngate and it was locked and estella was gone when we stood in the\\ndaylight alone again joe backed up against a wall and said to me\\nâ\\x80\\x9castonishingâ\\x80\\x9d and there he remained so long saying â\\x80\\x9castonishingâ\\x80\\x9d at\\nintervals so often that i began to think his senses were never coming\\nback at length he prolonged his remark into â\\x80\\x9cpip i do assure you\\nthis is astonishingâ\\x80\\x9d and so by degrees became conversational and\\nable to walk away\\n\\ni have reason to think that joeâ\\x80\\x99s intellects were brightened by the\\nencounter they had passed through and that on our way to pumblechookâ\\x80\\x99s\\nhe invented a subtle and deep design my reason is to be found in what\\ntook place in mr pumblechookâ\\x80\\x99s parlour where on our presenting\\nourselves my sister sat in conference with that detested seedsman\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwellâ\\x80\\x9d cried my sister addressing us both at once â\\x80\\x9cand whatâ\\x80\\x99s\\nhappened to you i wonder you condescend to come back to such poor\\nsociety as this i am sure i doâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmiss havishamâ\\x80\\x9d said joe with a fixed look at me like an effort of\\nremembrance â\\x80\\x9cmade it wery partickâ\\x80\\x99ler that we should give herâ\\x80\\x94were it\\ncompliments or respects pipâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ccomplimentsâ\\x80\\x9d i said\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhich that were my own beliefâ\\x80\\x9d answered joe â\\x80\\x9cher compliments to mrs\\nj gargeryâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmuch good theyâ\\x80\\x99ll do meâ\\x80\\x9d observed my sister but rather gratified\\ntoo\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cand wishingâ\\x80\\x9d pursued joe with another fixed look at me like another\\neffort of remembrance â\\x80\\x9cthat the state of miss havishamâ\\x80\\x99s elth were\\nsitch as would haveâ\\x80\\x94allowed were it pipâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cof her having the pleasureâ\\x80\\x9d i added\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cof ladiesâ\\x80\\x99 companyâ\\x80\\x9d said joe and drew a long breath\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwellâ\\x80\\x9d cried my sister with a mollified glance at mr pumblechook\\nâ\\x80\\x9cshe might have had the politeness to send that message at first but\\nitâ\\x80\\x99s better late than never and what did she give young rantipole\\nhereâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cshe givâ\\x80\\x99 himâ\\x80\\x9d said joe â\\x80\\x9cnothingâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nmrs joe was going to break out but joe went on\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhat she givâ\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d said joe â\\x80\\x9cshe givâ\\x80\\x99 to his friends

the elbows of his wooden\\narmchair and nodded at her and at the fire as if he had known all\\nabout it beforehand\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cand how much have you gotâ\\x80\\x9d asked my sister laughing positively\\nlaughing\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhat would present company say to ten poundâ\\x80\\x9d demanded joe\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ctheyâ\\x80\\x99d sayâ\\x80\\x9d returned my sister curtly â\\x80\\x9cpretty well not too much\\nbut pretty wellâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s more than that thenâ\\x80\\x9d said joe\\n\\nthat fearful impostor pumblechook immediately nodded and said as he\\nrubbed the arms of his chair â\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s more than that mumâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhy you donâ\\x80\\x99t mean to sayâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d began my sister\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyes i do

poundâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s fiveandtwenty pound mumâ\\x80\\x9d echoed that basest of swindlers\\npumblechook rising to shake hands with her â\\x80\\x9cand itâ\\x80\\x99s no more than\\nyour merits as i said when my opinion was asked and i wish you joy\\nof the moneyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nif the villain had stopped here his case would have been sufficiently\\nawful but he blackened his guilt by proceeding to take me into\\ncustody with a right of patronage that left all his former criminality\\nfar behind\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnow you see joseph and wifeâ\\x80\\x9d said pumblechook as he took me by the\\narm above the elbow â\\x80\\x9ci am one of them that always go right through\\nwith what theyâ\\x80\\x99ve begun this boy must be bound out of hand thatâ\\x80\\x99s\\nmy way bound

to joe in the magisterial\\npresence i say we went over but i was pushed over by pumblechook\\nexactly as if i had that moment picked a pocket or fired a rick\\nindeed it was the general impression in court that i had been taken\\nredhanded for as pumblechook shoved me before him through the crowd\\ni heard some people say â\\x80\\x9cwhatâ\\x80\\x99s he doneâ\\x80\\x9d and others â\\x80\\x9cheâ\\x80\\x99s a young\\nâ\\x80\\x99un too but looks bad donâ\\x80\\x99t heâ\\x80\\x9d one person of mild and benevolent\\naspect even gave me a tract ornamented with a woodcut of a malevolent\\nyoung man fitted up with a perfect sausageshop of fetters and\\nentitled to be read in my cell\\n\\nthe hall was a queer place i thought with higher pews in it than a\\nchurchâ\\x80\\x94and with people hanging over the pews looking onâ\\x80\\x94and with\\nmighty justices one with a powdered head leaning back in chairs with\\nfolded arms or taking snuff or going to sleep or writing or reading\\nthe newspapersâ\\x80\\x94and with some shining black portraits on the walls\\nwhich my unartistic eye regarded as a composition of hardbake and\\nstickingplaster here in a corner my indentures were duly signed and\\nattested and i was â\\x80\\x9cboundâ\\x80\\x9d mr pumblechook holding me all the while\\nas if we had looked in on our way to the scaffold to have those little\\npreliminaries disposed of\\n\\nwhen we had come out again and had got rid of the boys who had been\\nput into great spirits by the expectation of seeing me publicly\\ntortured and who were much disappointed to find that my friends were\\nmerely rallying round me we went back to pumblechookâ\\x80\\x99s and there my\\nsister became so excited by the twentyfive guineas that nothing would\\nserve her but we must have a dinner out of that windfall at the blue\\nboar and that pumblechook must go over in his chaisecart and bring\\nthe hubbles and mr wopsle\\n\\nit was agreed to be done and a most melancholy day i passed for it\\ninscrutably appeared to stand to reason in the minds of the whole\\ncompany that i was an excrescence on the entertainment and to make it\\nworse they all asked me from time to timeâ\\x80\\x94in short whenever they had\\nnothing else to doâ\\x80\\x94why i didnâ\\x80\\x99t enjoy myself and what could i\\npossibly do then but say i was enjoying myselfâ\\x80\\x94when i wasnâ\\x80\\x99t\\n\\nhowever they were grown up and had their own way and they made the\\nmost of it that swindling pumblechook exalted into the beneficent\\ncontriver of the whole occasion actually took the top of the table\\nand when he addressed them on the subject of my being bound and had\\nfiendishly congratulated them on my being liable to imprisonment if i\\nplayed at cards drank strong liquors kept late hours or bad company\\nor indulged in other vagaries which the form of my indentures appeared\\nto contemplate as next to inevitable he placed me standing on a chair\\nbeside him to illustrate his remarks\\n\\nmy only other remembrances of the great festival are that they\\nwouldnâ\\x80\\x99t let me go to sleep but whenever they saw me dropping off\\nwoke me up and told me to enjoy myself that rather late in the\\nevening mr wopsle gave us collinsâ\\x80\\x99s ode and threw his bloodstained\\nsword in thunder down with such effect that a waiter came in and\\nsaid â\\x80\\x9cthe commercials underneath sent up their compliments and it\\nwasnâ\\x80\\x99t the tumblersâ\\x80\\x99 armsâ\\x80\\x9d that they were all in excellent spirits on\\nthe road home and sang o lady fair mr wopsle taking the bass and\\nasserting with a tremendously strong voice in reply to the inquisitive\\nbore who leads that piece of music in a most impertinent manner by\\nwanting to know all about everybodyâ\\x80\\x99s private affairs that he was\\nthe man with his white locks flowing and that he was upon the whole\\nthe weakest pilgrim going\\n\\nfinally i remember that when i got into my little bedroom i was truly\\nwretched and had a strong conviction on me that i should never like\\njoeâ\\x80\\x99s trade i had liked it once but once was not now\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter xiv\\n\\n\\nit is a most miserable thing to feel ashamed of home there may be\\nblack ingratitude in the thing and the punishment may be retributive\\nand well deserved but that it is a miserable thing i can testify\\n\\nhome had never been a very pleasant place to me because of my sisterâ\\x80\\x99s\\ntemper but joe had sanctified it and i had believed in it i had\\nbelieved in the best parlour as a most elegant saloon i had believed\\nin the front door as a mysterious portal of the temple of state whose\\nsolemn opening was attended with a sacrifice of roast fowls i had\\nbelieved in the kitchen as a chaste though not magnificent apartment i\\nhad believed in the forge as the glowing road to manhood and\\nindependence within a single year all this was changed now it was all\\ncoarse and common and i would not have had miss havisham and estella\\nsee it on any account\\n\\nhow much of my ungracious condition of mind may have been my own fault\\nhow much miss havishamâ\\x80\\x99s how much my sisterâ\\x80\\x99s is now of no moment to\\nme or to any one the change was made in me the thing was done well\\nor ill done excusably or inexcusably it was done\\n\\nonce it had seemed to me that when i should at last roll up my\\nshirtsleeves and go into the forge joeâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x99prentice i should be\\ndistinguished and happy now the reality was in my hold i only felt\\nthat i was dusty with the dust of smallcoal and that i had a weight\\nupon my daily remembrance to which the anvil was a feather there have\\nbeen occasions in my later life i suppose as in most lives when i\\nhave felt for a time as if a thick curtain had fallen on all its\\ninterest and romance to shut me out from anything save dull endurance\\nany more never has that curtain dropped so heavy and blank as when my\\nway in life lay stretched out straight before me through the newly\\nentered road of apprenticeship to joe\\n\\ni remember that at a later period of my â\\x80\\x9ctimeâ\\x80\\x9d i used to stand about\\nthe churchyard on sunday evenings when night was falling comparing my\\nown perspective with the windy marsh view and making out some likeness\\nbetween them by thinking how flat and low both were and how on both\\nthere came an unknown way and a dark mist and then the sea i was quite\\nas dejected on the first workingday of my apprenticeship as in that\\naftertime but i am glad to know that i never breathed a murmur to joe\\nwhile my indentures lasted it is about the only thing i am glad to\\nknow of myself in that connection\\n\\nfor though it includes what i proceed to add all the merit of what i\\nproceed to add was joeâ\\x80\\x99s it was not because i was faithful but\\nbecause joe was faithful that i never ran away and went for a soldier\\nor a sailor it was not because i had a strong sense of the virtue of\\nindustry but because joe had a strong sense of the virtue of industry\\nthat i worked with tolerable zeal against the grain it is not possible\\nto know how far the influence of any amiable honesthearted dutydoing\\nman flies out into the world but it is very possible to know how it\\nhas touched oneâ\\x80\\x99s self in going by and i know right well that any good\\nthat intermixed itself with my apprenticeship came of plain contented\\njoe and not of restlessly aspiring discontented me\\n\\nwhat i wanted who can say how can i say when i never knew what i\\ndreaded was that in some unlucky hour i being at my grimiest and\\ncommonest should lift up my eyes and see estella looking in at one of\\nthe wooden windows of the forge i was haunted by the fear that she\\nwould sooner or later find me out with a black face and hands doing\\nthe coarsest part of my work and would exult over me and despise me\\noften after dark when i was pulling the bellows for joe and we were\\nsinging old clem and when the thought how we used to sing it at miss\\nhavishamâ\\x80\\x99s would seem to show me estellaâ\\x80\\x99s face in the fire with her\\npretty hair fluttering in the wind and her eyes scorning meâ\\x80\\x94often at\\nsuch a time i would look towards those panels of black night in the\\nwall which the wooden windows then were and would fancy that i saw her\\njust drawing her face away and would believe that she had come at\\nlast\\n\\nafter that when we went in to supper the place and the meal would\\nhave a more homely look than ever and i would feel more ashamed of\\nhome than ever in my own ungracious breast\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter xv\\n\\n\\nas i was getting too big for mr wopsleâ\\x80\\x99s greatauntâ\\x80\\x99s room my\\neducation under that preposterous female terminated not however\\nuntil biddy had imparted to me everything she knew from the little\\ncatalogue of prices to a comic song she had once bought for a\\nhalfpenny although the only coherent part of the latter piece of\\nliterature were the opening lines\\n\\n     when i went to lunnon town sirs\\n     too rul loo rul\\n     too rul loo rul\\n     wasnâ\\x80\\x99t i done very brown sirs\\n     too rul loo rul\\n     too rul loo rul\\n\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x94still in my desire to be wiser i got this composition by heart with\\nthe utmost gravity nor do i recollect that i questioned its merit\\nexcept that i thought as i still do the amount of too rul somewhat in\\nexcess of the poetry in my hunger for information i made proposals to\\nmr wopsle to bestow some intellectual crumbs upon me with which he\\nkindly complied as it turned out however that he only wanted me for\\na dramatic layfigure to be contradicted and embraced and wept over\\nand bullied and clutched and stabbed and knocked about in a variety of\\nways i soon declined that course of instruction though not until mr\\nwopsle in his poetic fury had severely mauled me\\n\\nwhatever i acquired i tried to impart to joe this statement sounds so\\nwell that i cannot in my conscience let it pass unexplained i wanted\\nto make joe less ignorant and common that he might be worthier of my\\nsociety and less open to estellaâ\\x80\\x99s reproach\\n\\nthe old battery out on the marshes was our place of study and a broken\\nslate and a short piece of slatepencil were our educational\\nimplements to which joe always added a pipe of tobacco i never knew\\njoe to remember anything from one sunday to another or to acquire\\nunder my tuition any piece of information whatever yet he would smoke\\nhis pipe at the battery with a far more sagacious air than anywhere\\nelseâ\\x80\\x94even with a learned airâ\\x80\\x94as if he considered himself to be\\nadvancing immensely dear fellow i hope he did\\n\\nit was pleasant and quiet out there with the sails on the river\\npassing beyond the earthwork and sometimes when the tide was low\\nlooking as if they belonged to sunken ships that were still sailing on\\nat the bottom of the water whenever i watched the vessels standing out\\nto sea with their white sails spread i somehow thought of miss\\nhavisham and estella and whenever the light struck aslant afar off\\nupon a cloud or sail or green hillside or waterline it was just the\\nsameâ\\x80\\x94miss havisham and estella and the strange house and the strange\\nlife appeared to have something to do with everything that was\\npicturesque\\n\\none sunday when joe greatly enjoying his pipe had so plumed himself\\non being â\\x80\\x9cmost awful dullâ\\x80\\x9d that i had given him up for the day i lay\\non the earthwork for some time with my chin on my hand descrying\\ntraces of miss havisham and estella all over the prospect in the sky\\nand in the water until at last i resolved to mention a thought\\nconcerning them that had been much in my head\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cjoeâ\\x80\\x9d said i â\\x80\\x9cdonâ\\x80\\x99t you think i ought to make miss havisham a visitâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwell pipâ\\x80\\x9d returned joe slowly considering â\\x80\\x9cwhat forâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhat for joe what is any visit made forâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthere is some wisits pâ\\x80\\x99râ\\x80\\x99apsâ\\x80\\x9d said joe â\\x80\\x9cas for ever remains open to\\nthe question pip but in regard to wisiting miss havisham she might\\nthink you wanted somethingâ\\x80\\x94expected something of herâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cdonâ\\x80\\x99t you think i might say that i did not joeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou might old chapâ\\x80\\x9d said joe â\\x80\\x9cand she might credit it similarly\\nshe mightnâ\\x80\\x99tâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\njoe felt as i did that he had made a point there and he pulled hard\\nat his pipe to keep himself from weakening it by repetition\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou see pipâ\\x80\\x9d joe pursued as soon as he was past that danger â\\x80\\x9cmiss\\nhavisham done the handsome thing by you when miss havisham done the\\nhandsome thing by you she called me back to say to me as that were\\nallâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyes joe i heard herâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9callâ\\x80\\x9d joe repeated very emphatically\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyes joe i tell you i heard herâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhich i meantersay pip it might be that her meaning wereâ\\x80\\x94make a end\\non itâ\\x80\\x94as you wasâ\\x80\\x94me to the north and you to the southâ\\x80\\x94keep in\\nsundersâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni had thought of that too and it was very far from comforting to me to\\nfind that he had thought of it for it seemed to render it more\\nprobable\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbut joeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyes old chapâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9chere am i getting on in the first year of my time and since the day\\nof my being bound i have never thanked miss havisham or asked after\\nher or shown that i remember herâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthatâ\\x80\\x99s true pip and unless you was to turn her out a set of shoes\\nall four roundâ\\x80\\x94and which i meantersay as even a set of shoes all four\\nround might not be acceptable as a present in a total wacancy of\\nhoofsâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci donâ\\x80\\x99t mean that sort of remembrance joe i donâ\\x80\\x99t mean a presentâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nbut joe had got the idea of a present in his head and must harp upon\\nit â\\x80\\x9cor evenâ\\x80\\x9d said he â\\x80\\x9cif you was helped to knocking her up a new\\nchain for the front doorâ\\x80\\x94or say a gross or two of sharkheaded screws\\nfor general useâ\\x80\\x94or some light fancy article such as a toastingfork\\nwhen she took her muffinsâ\\x80\\x94or a gridiron when she took a sprat or such\\nlikeâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci donâ\\x80\\x99t mean any present at all joeâ\\x80\\x9d i interposed\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwellâ\\x80\\x9d said joe still harping on it as though i had particularly\\npressed it â\\x80\\x9cif i was yourself pip i wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t no i would not for\\nwhatâ\\x80\\x99s a doorchain when sheâ\\x80\\x99s got one always up and sharkheaders is\\nopen to misrepresentations and if it was a toastingfork youâ\\x80\\x99d go\\ninto brass and do yourself no credit and the oncommonest workman canâ\\x80\\x99t\\nshow himself oncommon in a gridironâ\\x80\\x94for a gridiron is a gridironâ\\x80\\x9d\\nsaid joe steadfastly impressing it upon me as if he were endeavouring\\nto rouse me from a fixed delusion â\\x80\\x9cand you may haim at what you like\\nbut a gridiron it will come out either by your leave or again your\\nleave and you canâ\\x80\\x99t help yourselfâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmy dear joeâ\\x80\\x9d i cried in desperation taking hold of his coat â\\x80\\x9cdonâ\\x80\\x99t\\ngo on in that way i never thought of making miss havisham any\\npresentâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cno pipâ\\x80\\x9d joe assented as if he had been contending for that all\\nalong â\\x80\\x9cand what i say to you is you are right pipâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyes joe but what i wanted to say was that as we are rather slack\\njust now if you would give me a halfholiday tomorrow i think i\\nwould go uptown and make a call on miss estâ\\x80\\x94havishamâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhich her nameâ\\x80\\x9d said joe gravely â\\x80\\x9cainâ\\x80\\x99t estavisham pip unless she\\nhave been rechrisâ\\x80\\x99enedâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci know joe i know it was a slip of mine what do you think of it\\njoeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nin brief joe thought that if i thought well of it he thought well of\\nit but he was particular in stipulating that if i were not received\\nwith cordiality or if i were not encouraged to repeat my visit as a\\nvisit which had no ulterior object but was simply one of gratitude for\\na favour received then this experimental trip should have no\\nsuccessor by these conditions i promised to abide\\n\\nnow joe kept a journeyman at weekly wages whose name was orlick he\\npretended that his christian name was dolgeâ\\x80\\x94a clear impossibilityâ\\x80\\x94but\\nhe was a fellow of that obstinate disposition that i believe him to\\nhave been the prey of no delusion in this particular but wilfully to\\nhave imposed that name upon the village as an affront to its\\nunderstanding he was a broadshouldered looselimbed swarthy fellow of\\ngreat strength never in a hurry and always slouching he never even\\nseemed to come to his work on purpose but would slouch in as if by\\nmere accident and when he went to the jolly bargemen to eat his\\ndinner or went away at night he would slouch out like cain or the\\nwandering jew as if he had no idea where he was going and no intention\\nof ever coming back he lodged at a sluicekeeperâ\\x80\\x99s out on the marshes\\nand on workingdays would come slouching from his hermitage with his\\nhands in his pockets and his dinner loosely tied in a bundle round his\\nneck and dangling on his back on sundays he mostly lay all day on the\\nsluicegates or stood against ricks and barns he always slouched\\nlocomotively with his eyes on the ground and when accosted or\\notherwise required to raise them he looked up in a halfresentful\\nhalfpuzzled way as though the only thought he ever had was that it\\nwas rather an odd and injurious fact that he should never be thinking\\n\\nthis morose journeyman had no liking for me when i was very small and\\ntimid he gave me to understand that the devil lived in a black corner\\nof the forge and that he knew the fiend very well also that it was\\nnecessary to make up the fire once in seven years with a live boy\\nand that i might consider myself fuel when i became joeâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x99prentice\\norlick was perhaps confirmed in some suspicion that i should displace\\nhim howbeit he liked me still less not that he ever said anything\\nor did anything openly importing hostility i only noticed that he\\nalways beat his sparks in my direction and that whenever i sang old\\nclem he came in out of time\\n\\ndolge orlick was at work and present next day when i reminded joe of\\nmy halfholiday he said nothing at the moment for he and joe had just\\ngot a piece of hot iron between them and i was at the bellows but by\\nand by he said leaning on his hammerâ\\x80\\x94\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnow master sure youâ\\x80\\x99re not agoing to favour only one of us if\\nyoung pip has a halfholiday do as much for old orlickâ\\x80\\x9d i suppose he\\nwas about fiveandtwenty but he usually spoke of himself as an\\nancient person\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhy whatâ\\x80\\x99ll you do with a halfholiday if you get itâ\\x80\\x9d said joe\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhatâ\\x80\\x99ll i do with it whatâ\\x80\\x99ll he do with it iâ\\x80\\x99ll do as much with\\nit as himâ\\x80\\x9d said orlick\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cas to pip heâ\\x80\\x99s going up townâ\\x80\\x9d said joe\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwell then as to old orlick heâ\\x80\\x99s agoing up townâ\\x80\\x9d retorted that\\nworthy â\\x80\\x9ctwo can go up town tainâ\\x80\\x99t only one wot can go up town\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cdonâ\\x80\\x99t lose your temperâ\\x80\\x9d said joe\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cshall if i likeâ\\x80\\x9d growled orlick â\\x80\\x9csome and their uptowning now\\nmaster come no favouring in this shop be a manâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthe master refusing to entertain the subject until the journeyman was\\nin a better temper orlick plunged at the furnace drew out a redhot\\nbar made at me with it as if he were going to run it through my body\\nwhisked it round my head laid it on the anvil hammered it outâ\\x80\\x94as if\\nit were i i thought and the sparks were my spirting bloodâ\\x80\\x94and\\nfinally said when he had hammered himself hot and the iron cold and\\nhe again leaned on his hammerâ\\x80\\x94\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnow masterâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9care you all right nowâ\\x80\\x9d demanded joe\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cah i am all rightâ\\x80\\x9d said gruff old orlick\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthen as in general you stick to your work as well as most menâ\\x80\\x9d said\\njoe â\\x80\\x9clet it be a halfholiday for allâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nmy sister had been standing silent in the yard within hearingâ\\x80\\x94she was\\na most unscrupulous spy and listenerâ\\x80\\x94and she instantly looked in at\\none of the windows\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9clike you you foolâ\\x80\\x9d said she to joe â\\x80\\x9cgiving holidays to great idle\\nhulkers like that you are a rich man upon my life to waste wages in\\nthat way i wish i was his masterâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyouâ\\x80\\x99d be everybodyâ\\x80\\x99s master if you durstâ\\x80\\x9d retorted orlick with an\\nillfavoured grin\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9clet her aloneâ\\x80\\x9d said joe\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ciâ\\x80\\x99d be a match for all noodles and all roguesâ\\x80\\x9d returned my sister\\nbeginning to work herself into a mighty rage â\\x80\\x9cand i couldnâ\\x80\\x99t be a\\nmatch for the noodles without being a match for your master whoâ\\x80\\x99s the\\ndunderheaded king of the noodles and i couldnâ\\x80\\x99t be a match for the\\nrogues without being a match for you who are the blackestlooking and\\nthe worst rogue between this and france nowâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyouâ\\x80\\x99re a foul shrew mother gargeryâ\\x80\\x9d growled the journeyman â\\x80\\x9cif that\\nmakes a judge of rogues you ought to be a goodâ\\x80\\x99unâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9clet her alone will youâ\\x80\\x9d said joe\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhat did you sayâ\\x80\\x9d cried my sister beginning to scream â\\x80\\x9cwhat did you\\nsay what did that fellow orlick say to me pip what did he call me\\nwith my husband standing by oh oh ohâ\\x80\\x9d each of these exclamations\\nwas a shriek and i must remark of my sister what is equally true of\\nall the violent women i have ever seen that passion was no excuse for\\nher because it is undeniable that instead of lapsing into passion she\\nconsciously and deliberately took extraordinary pains to force herself\\ninto it and became blindly furious by regular stages â\\x80\\x9cwhat was the\\nname he gave me before the base man who swore to defend me oh hold\\nme ohâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cahhhâ\\x80\\x9d growled the journeyman between his teeth â\\x80\\x9ciâ\\x80\\x99d hold you if\\nyou was my wife iâ\\x80\\x99d hold you under the pump and choke it out of youâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci tell you let her aloneâ\\x80\\x9d said joe\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9coh to hear himâ\\x80\\x9d cried my sister with a clap of her hands and a\\nscream togetherâ\\x80\\x94which was her next stage â\\x80\\x9cto hear the names heâ\\x80\\x99s\\ngiving me that orlick in my own house me a married woman with my\\nhusband standing by oh ohâ\\x80\\x9d here my sister after a fit of clappings\\nand screamings beat her hands upon her bosom and upon her knees and\\nthrew her cap off and pulled her hair downâ\\x80\\x94which were the last stages\\non her road to frenzy being by this time a perfect fury and a complete\\nsuccess she made a dash at the door which i had fortunately locked\\n\\nwhat could the wretched joe do now after his disregarded parenthetical\\ninterruptions but stand up to his journeyman and ask him what he\\nmeant by interfering betwixt himself and mrs joe and further whether\\nhe was man enough to come on old orlick felt that the situation\\nadmitted of nothing less than coming on and was on his defence\\nstraightway so without so much as pulling off their singed and burnt\\naprons they went at one another like two giants but if any man in\\nthat neighbourhood could stand uplong against joe i never saw the man\\norlick as if he had been of no more account than the pale young\\ngentleman was very soon among the coaldust and in no hurry to come\\nout of it then joe unlocked the door and picked up my sister who had\\ndropped insensible at the window but who had seen the fight first i\\nthink and who was carried into the house and laid down and who was\\nrecommended to revive and would do nothing but struggle and clench her\\nhands in joeâ\\x80\\x99s hair then came that singular calm and silence which\\nsucceed all uproars and then with the vague sensation which i have\\nalways connected with such a lullâ\\x80\\x94namely that it was sunday and\\nsomebody was deadâ\\x80\\x94i went upstairs to dress myself\\n\\nillustration\\n\\nwhen i came down again i found joe and orlick sweeping up without any\\nother traces of discomposure than a slit in one of orlickâ\\x80\\x99s nostrils\\nwhich was neither expressive nor ornamental a pot of beer had appeared\\nfrom the jolly bargemen and they were sharing it by turns in a\\npeaceable manner the lull had a sedative and philosophical influence\\non joe who followed me out into the road to say as a parting\\nobservation that might do me good â\\x80\\x9con the rampage pip and off the\\nrampage pipâ\\x80\\x94such is lifeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nwith what absurd emotions for we think the feelings that are very\\nserious in a man quite comical in a boy i found myself again going to\\nmiss havishamâ\\x80\\x99s matters little here nor how i passed and repassed\\nthe gate many times before i could make up my mind to ring nor how i\\ndebated whether i should go away without ringing nor how i should\\nundoubtedly have gone if my time had been my own to come back\\n\\nmiss sarah pocket came to the gate no estella\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9chow then you here againâ\\x80\\x9d said miss pocket â\\x80\\x9cwhat do you wantâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nwhen i said that i only came to see how miss havisham was sarah\\nevidently deliberated whether or no she should send me about my\\nbusiness but unwilling to hazard the responsibility she let me in\\nand presently brought the sharp message that i was to â\\x80\\x9ccome upâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\neverything was unchanged and miss havisham was alone\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwellâ\\x80\\x9d said she fixing her eyes upon me â\\x80\\x9ci hope you want nothing\\nyouâ\\x80\\x99ll get nothingâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cno indeed miss havisham i only wanted you to know that i am doing\\nvery well in my apprenticeship and am always much obliged to youâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthere thereâ\\x80\\x9d with the old restless fingers â\\x80\\x9ccome now and then come\\non your birthdayâ\\x80\\x94ayâ\\x80\\x9d she cried suddenly turning herself and her\\nchair towards me â\\x80\\x9cyou are looking round for estella heyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni had been looking roundâ\\x80\\x94in fact for estellaâ\\x80\\x94and i stammered that i\\nhoped she was well\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cabroadâ\\x80\\x9d said miss havisham â\\x80\\x9ceducating for a lady far out of reach\\nprettier than ever admired by all who see her do you feel that you\\nhave lost herâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthere was such a malignant enjoyment in her utterance of the last\\nwords and she broke into such a disagreeable laugh that i was at a\\nloss what to say she spared me the trouble of considering by\\ndismissing me when the gate was closed upon me by sarah of the\\nwalnutshell countenance i felt more than ever dissatisfied with my\\nhome and with my trade and with everything and that was all i took by\\nthat motion\\n\\nas i was loitering along the high street looking in disconsolately at\\nthe shop windows and thinking what i would buy if i were a gentleman\\nwho should come out of the bookshop but mr wopsle mr wopsle had in\\nhis hand the affecting tragedy of george barnwell in which he had that\\nmoment invested sixpence with the view of heaping every word of it on\\nthe head of pumblechook with whom he was going to drink tea no sooner\\ndid he see me than he appeared to consider that a special providence\\nhad put a â\\x80\\x99prentice in his way to be read at and he laid hold of me\\nand insisted on my accompanying him to the pumblechookian parlour as i\\nknew it would be miserable at home and as the nights were dark and the\\nway was dreary and almost any companionship on the road was better\\nthan none i made no great resistance consequently we turned into\\npumblechookâ\\x80\\x99s just as the street and the shops were lighting up\\n\\nas i never assisted at any other representation of george barnwell i\\ndonâ\\x80\\x99t know how long it may usually take but i know very well that it\\ntook until halfpast nine oâ\\x80\\x99 clock that night and that when mr wopsle\\ngot into newgate i thought he never would go to the scaffold he\\nbecame so much slower than at any former period of his disgraceful\\ncareer i thought it a little too much that he should complain of being\\ncut short in his flower after all as if he had not been running to\\nseed leaf after leaf ever since his course began this however was\\na mere question of length and wearisomeness what stung me was the\\nidentification of the whole affair with my unoffending self when\\nbarnwell began to go wrong i declare that i felt positively\\napologetic pumblechookâ\\x80\\x99s indignant stare so taxed me with it wopsle\\ntoo took pains to present me in the worst light at once ferocious and\\nmaudlin i was made to murder my uncle with no extenuating\\ncircumstances whatever millwood put me down in argument on every\\noccasion it became sheer monomania in my masterâ\\x80\\x99s daughter to care a\\nbutton for me and all i can say for my gasping and procrastinating\\nconduct on the fatal morning is that it was worthy of the general\\nfeebleness of my character even after i was happily hanged and wopsle\\nhad closed the book pumblechook sat staring at me and shaking his\\nhead and saying â\\x80\\x9ctake warning boy take warningâ\\x80\\x9d as if it were a\\nwellknown fact that i contemplated murdering a near relation provided\\ni could only induce one to have the weakness to become my benefactor\\n\\nit was a very dark night when it was all over and when i set out with\\nmr wopsle on the walk home beyond town we found a heavy mist out\\nand it fell wet and thick the turnpike lamp was a blur quite out of\\nthe lampâ\\x80\\x99s usual place apparently and its rays looked solid substance\\non the fog we were noticing this and saying how that the mist rose\\nwith a change of wind from a certain quarter of our marshes when we\\ncame upon a man slouching under the lee of the turnpike house\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9challoaâ\\x80\\x9d we said stopping â\\x80\\x9corlick thereâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cahâ\\x80\\x9d he answered slouching out â\\x80\\x9ci was standing by a minute on the\\nchance of companyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou are lateâ\\x80\\x9d i remarked\\n\\norlick not unnaturally answered â\\x80\\x9cwell and youâ\\x80\\x99re lateâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwe have beenâ\\x80\\x9d said mr wopsle exalted with his late performanceâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cwe\\nhave been indulging mr orlick in an intellectual eveningâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nold orlick growled as if he had nothing to say about that and we all\\nwent on together i asked him presently whether he had been spending\\nhis halfholiday up and down town\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyesâ\\x80\\x9d said he â\\x80\\x9call of it i come in behind yourself i didnâ\\x80\\x99t see\\nyou but i must have been pretty close behind you by the by the guns\\nis going againâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cat the hulksâ\\x80\\x9d said i\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cay thereâ\\x80\\x99s some of the birds flown from the cages the guns have been\\ngoing since dark about youâ\\x80\\x99ll hear one presentlyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nin effect we had not walked many yards further when the\\nwellremembered boom came towards us deadened by the mist and heavily\\nrolled away along the low grounds by the river as if it were pursuing\\nand threatening the fugitives\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ca good night for cutting off inâ\\x80\\x9d said orlick â\\x80\\x9cweâ\\x80\\x99d be puzzled how to\\nbring down a jailbird on the wing tonightâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthe subject was a suggestive one to me and i thought about it in\\nsilence mr wopsle as the illrequited uncle of the eveningâ\\x80\\x99s\\ntragedy fell to meditating aloud in his garden at camberwell orlick\\nwith his hands in his pockets slouched heavily at my side it was very\\ndark very wet very muddy and so we splashed along now and then the\\nsound of the signal cannon broke upon us again and again rolled\\nsulkily along the course of the river i kept myself to myself and my\\nthoughts mr wopsle died amiably at camberwell and exceedingly game\\non bosworth field and in the greatest agonies at glastonbury orlick\\nsometimes growled â\\x80\\x9cbeat it out beat it outâ\\x80\\x94old clem with a clink\\nfor the stoutâ\\x80\\x94old clemâ\\x80\\x9d i thought he had been drinking but he was\\nnot drunk\\n\\nthus we came to the village the way by which we approached it took us\\npast the three jolly bargemen which we were surprised to findâ\\x80\\x94it being\\neleven oâ\\x80\\x99clockâ\\x80\\x94in a state of commotion with the door wide open and\\nunwonted lights that had been hastily caught up and put down scattered\\nabout mr wopsle dropped in to ask what was the matter surmising that\\na convict had been taken but came running out in a great hurry\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthereâ\\x80\\x99s something wrongâ\\x80\\x9d said he without stopping â\\x80\\x9cup at your\\nplace pip run allâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhat is itâ\\x80\\x9d i asked keeping up with him so did orlick at my side\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci canâ\\x80\\x99t quite understand the house seems to have been violently\\nentered when joe gargery was out supposed by convicts somebody has\\nbeen attacked and hurtâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nwe were running too fast to admit of more being said and we made no\\nstop until we got into our kitchen it was full of people the whole\\nvillage was there or in the yard and there was a surgeon and there\\nwas joe and there were a group of women all on the floor in the midst\\nof the kitchen the unemployed bystanders drew back when they saw me\\nand so i became aware of my sisterâ\\x80\\x94lying without sense or movement on\\nthe bare boards where she had been knocked down by a tremendous blow on\\nthe back of the head dealt by some unknown hand when her face was\\nturned towards the fireâ\\x80\\x94destined never to be on the rampage again\\nwhile she was the wife of joe\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter xvi\\n\\n\\nwith my head full of george barnwell i was at first disposed to\\nbelieve that i must have had some hand in the attack upon my sister\\nor at all events that as her near relation popularly known to be under\\nobligations to her i was a more legitimate object of suspicion than\\nany one else but when in the clearer light of next morning i began\\nto reconsider the matter and to hear it discussed around me on all\\nsides i took another view of the case which was more reasonable\\n\\njoe had been at the three jolly bargemen smoking his pipe from a\\nquarter after eight oâ\\x80\\x99clock to a quarter before ten while he was\\nthere my sister had been seen standing at the kitchen door and had\\nexchanged good night with a farmlabourer going home the man could not\\nbe more particular as to the time at which he saw her he got into\\ndense confusion when he tried to be than that it must have been\\nbefore nine when joe went home at five minutes before ten he found\\nher struck down on the floor and promptly called in assistance the\\nfire had not then burnt unusually low nor was the snuff of the candle\\nvery long the candle however had been blown out\\n\\nnothing had been taken away from any part of the house neither beyond\\nthe blowing out of the candleâ\\x80\\x94which stood on a table between the door\\nand my sister and was behind her when she stood facing the fire and\\nwas struckâ\\x80\\x94was there any disarrangement of the kitchen excepting such\\nas she herself had made in falling and bleeding but there was one\\nremarkable piece of evidence on the spot she had been struck with\\nsomething blunt and heavy on the head and spine after the blows were\\ndealt something heavy had been thrown down at her with considerable\\nviolence as she lay on her face and on the ground beside her when\\njoe picked her up was a convictâ\\x80\\x99s legiron which had been filed\\nasunder\\n\\nnow joe examining this iron with a smithâ\\x80\\x99s eye declared it to have\\nbeen filed asunder some time ago the hue and cry going off to the\\nhulks and people coming thence to examine the iron joeâ\\x80\\x99s opinion was\\ncorroborated they did not undertake to say when it had left the\\nprisonships to which it undoubtedly had once belonged but they\\nclaimed to know for certain that that particular manacle had not been\\nworn by either of the two convicts who had escaped last night further\\none of those two was already retaken and had not freed himself of his\\niron\\n\\nknowing what i knew i set up an inference of my own here i believed\\nthe iron to be my convictâ\\x80\\x99s ironâ\\x80\\x94the iron i had seen and heard him\\nfiling at on the marshesâ\\x80\\x94but my mind did not accuse him of having put\\nit to its latest use for i believed one of two other persons to have\\nbecome possessed of it and to have turned it to this cruel account\\neither orlick or the strange man who had shown me the file\\n\\nnow as to orlick he had gone to town exactly as he told us when we\\npicked him up at the turnpike he had been seen about town all the\\nevening he had been in divers companies in several publichouses and\\nhe had come back with myself and mr wopsle there was nothing against\\nhim save the quarrel and my sister had quarrelled with him and with\\neverybody else about her ten thousand times as to the strange man if\\nhe had come back for his two banknotes there could have been no\\ndispute about them because my sister was fully prepared to restore\\nthem besides there had been no altercation the assailant had come in\\nso silently and suddenly that she had been felled before she could\\nlook round\\n\\nit was horrible to think that i had provided the weapon however\\nundesignedly but i could hardly think otherwise i suffered\\nunspeakable trouble while i considered and reconsidered whether i\\nshould at last dissolve that spell of my childhood and tell joe all the\\nstory for months afterwards i every day settled the question finally\\nin the negative and reopened and reargued it next morning the\\ncontention came after all to thisâ\\x80\\x94the secret was such an old one\\nnow had so grown into me and become a part of myself that i could not\\ntear it away in addition to the dread that having led up to so much\\nmischief it would be now more likely than ever to alienate joe from me\\nif he believed it i had a further restraining dread that he would not\\nbelieve it but would assort it with the fabulous dogs and vealcutlets\\nas a monstrous invention however i temporized with myself of\\ncourseâ\\x80\\x94for was i not wavering between right and wrong when the thing\\nis always doneâ\\x80\\x94and resolved to make a full disclosure if i should see\\nany such new occasion as a new chance of helping in the discovery of\\nthe assailant\\n\\nthe constables and the bow street men from londonâ\\x80\\x94for this happened in\\nthe days of the extinct redwaistcoated policeâ\\x80\\x94were about the house for\\na week or two and did pretty much what i have heard and read of like\\nauthorities doing in other such cases they took up several obviously\\nwrong people and they ran their heads very hard against wrong ideas\\nand persisted in trying to fit the circumstances to the ideas instead\\nof trying to extract ideas from the circumstances also they stood\\nabout the door of the jolly bargemen with knowing and reserved looks\\nthat filled the whole neighbourhood with admiration and they had a\\nmysterious manner of taking their drink that was almost as good as\\ntaking the culprit but not quite for they never did it\\n\\nlong after these constitutional powers had dispersed my sister lay\\nvery ill in bed her sight was disturbed so that she saw objects\\nmultiplied and grasped at visionary teacups and wineglasses instead of\\nthe realities her hearing was greatly impaired her memory also and\\nher speech was unintelligible when at last she came round so far as\\nto be helped downstairs it was still necessary to keep my slate always\\nby her that she might indicate in writing what she could not indicate\\nin speech as she was very bad handwriting apart a more than\\nindifferent speller and as joe was a more than indifferent reader\\nextraordinary complications arose between them which i was always\\ncalled in to solve the administration of mutton instead of medicine\\nthe substitution of tea for joe and the baker for bacon were among\\nthe mildest of my own mistakes\\n\\nhowever her temper was greatly improved and she was patient a\\ntremulous uncertainty of the action of all her limbs soon became a part\\nof her regular state and afterwards at intervals of two or three\\nmonths she would often put her hands to her head and would then\\nremain for about a week at a time in some gloomy aberration of mind we\\nwere at a loss to find a suitable attendant for her until a\\ncircumstance happened conveniently to relieve us mr wopsleâ\\x80\\x99s\\ngreataunt conquered a confirmed habit of living into which she had\\nfallen and biddy became a part of our establishment\\n\\nit may have been about a month after my sisterâ\\x80\\x99s reappearance in the\\nkitchen when biddy came to us with a small speckled box containing the\\nwhole of her worldly effects and became a blessing to the household\\nabove all she was a blessing to joe for the dear old fellow was sadly\\ncut up by the constant contemplation of the wreck of his wife and had\\nbeen accustomed while attending on her of an evening to turn to me\\nevery now and then and say with his blue eyes moistened â\\x80\\x9csuch a fine\\nfigure of a woman as she once were pipâ\\x80\\x9d biddy instantly taking the\\ncleverest charge of her as though she had studied her from infancy joe\\nbecame able in some sort to appreciate the greater quiet of his life\\nand to get down to the jolly bargemen now and then for a change that\\ndid him good it was characteristic of the police people that they had\\nall more or less suspected poor joe though he never knew it and that\\nthey had to a man concurred in regarding him as one of the deepest\\nspirits they had ever encountered\\n\\nbiddyâ\\x80\\x99s first triumph in her new office was to solve a difficulty that\\nhad completely vanquished me i had tried hard at it but had made\\nnothing of it thus it wasâ\\x80\\x94\\n\\nagain and again and again my sister had traced upon the slate a\\ncharacter that looked like a curious t and then with the utmost\\neagerness had called our attention to it as something she particularly\\nwanted i had in vain tried everything producible that began with a t\\nfrom tar to toast and tub at length it had come into my head that the\\nsign looked like a hammer and on my lustily calling that word in my\\nsisterâ\\x80\\x99s ear she had begun to hammer on the table and had expressed a\\nqualified assent thereupon i had brought in all our hammers one\\nafter another but without avail then i bethought me of a crutch the\\nshape being much the same and i borrowed one in the village and\\ndisplayed it to my sister with considerable confidence but she shook\\nher head to that extent when she was shown it that we were terrified\\nlest in her weak and shattered state she should dislocate her neck\\n\\nwhen my sister found that biddy was very quick to understand her this\\nmysterious sign reappeared on the slate biddy looked thoughtfully at\\nit heard my explanation looked thoughtfully at my sister looked\\nthoughtfully at joe who was always represented on the slate by his\\ninitial letter and ran into the forge followed by joe and me\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhy of courseâ\\x80\\x9d cried biddy with an exultant face â\\x80\\x9cdonâ\\x80\\x99t you see\\nitâ\\x80\\x99s himâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\norlick without a doubt she had lost his name and could only signify\\nhim by his hammer we told him why we wanted him to come into the\\nkitchen and he slowly laid down his hammer wiped his brow with his\\narm took another wipe at it with his apron and came slouching out\\nwith a curious loose vagabond bend in the knees that strongly\\ndistinguished him\\n\\ni confess that i expected to see my sister denounce him and that i was\\ndisappointed by the different result she manifested the greatest\\nanxiety to be on good terms with him was evidently much pleased by his\\nbeing at length produced and motioned that she would have him given\\nsomething to drink she watched his countenance as if she were\\nparticularly wishful to be assured that he took kindly to his\\nreception she showed every possible desire to conciliate him and\\nthere was an air of humble propitiation in all she did such as i have\\nseen pervade the bearing of a child towards a hard master after that\\nday a day rarely passed without her drawing the hammer on her slate\\nand without orlickâ\\x80\\x99s slouching in and standing doggedly before her as\\nif he knew no more than i did what to make of it\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter xvii\\n\\n\\ni now fell into a regular routine of apprenticeship life which was\\nvaried beyond the limits of the village and the marshes by no more\\nremarkable circumstance than the arrival of my birthday and my paying\\nanother visit to miss havisham i found miss sarah pocket still on duty\\nat the gate i found miss havisham just as i had left her and she\\nspoke of estella in the very same way if not in the very same words\\nthe interview lasted but a few minutes and she gave me a guinea when i\\nwas going and told me to come again on my next birthday i may mention\\nat once that this became an annual custom i tried to decline taking\\nthe guinea on the first occasion but with no better effect than\\ncausing her to ask me very angrily if i expected more then and after\\nthat i took it\\n\\nso unchanging was the dull old house the yellow light in the darkened\\nroom the faded spectre in the chair by the dressingtable glass that\\ni felt as if the stopping of the clocks had stopped time in that\\nmysterious place and while i and everything else outside it grew\\nolder it stood still daylight never entered the house as to my\\nthoughts and remembrances of it any more than as to the actual fact\\nit bewildered me and under its influence i continued at heart to hate\\nmy trade and to be ashamed of home\\n\\nimperceptibly i became conscious of a change in biddy however her\\nshoes came up at the heel her hair grew bright and neat her hands\\nwere always clean she was not beautifulâ\\x80\\x94she was common and could not\\nbe like estellaâ\\x80\\x94but she was pleasant and wholesome and sweettempered\\nshe had not been with us more than a year i remember her being newly\\nout of mourning at the time it struck me when i observed to myself\\none evening that she had curiously thoughtful and attentive eyes eyes\\nthat were very pretty and very good\\n\\nit came of my lifting up my own eyes from a task i was poring\\natâ\\x80\\x94writing some passages from a book to improve myself in two ways at\\nonce by a sort of stratagemâ\\x80\\x94and seeing biddy observant of what i was\\nabout i laid down my pen and biddy stopped in her needlework without\\nlaying it down\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbiddyâ\\x80\\x9d said i â\\x80\\x9chow do you manage it either i am very stupid or you\\nare very cleverâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhat is it that i manage i donâ\\x80\\x99t knowâ\\x80\\x9d returned biddy smiling\\n\\nshe managed our whole domestic life and wonderfully too but i did not\\nmean that though that made what i did mean more surprising\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9chow do you manage biddyâ\\x80\\x9d said i â\\x80\\x9cto learn everything that i learn\\nand always to keep up with meâ\\x80\\x9d i was beginning to be rather vain of my\\nknowledge for i spent my birthday guineas on it and set aside the\\ngreater part of my pocketmoney for similar investment though i have\\nno doubt now that the little i knew was extremely dear at the price\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci might as well ask youâ\\x80\\x9d said biddy â\\x80\\x9chow you manageâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cno because when i come in from the forge of a night any one can see\\nme turning to at it but you never turn to at it biddyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci suppose i must catch it like a coughâ\\x80\\x9d said biddy quietly and went\\non with her sewing\\n\\npursuing my idea as i leaned back in my wooden chair and looked at\\nbiddy sewing away with her head on one side i began to think her\\nrather an extraordinary girl for i called to mind now that she was\\nequally accomplished in the terms of our trade and the names of our\\ndifferent sorts of work and our various tools in short whatever i\\nknew biddy knew theoretically she was already as good a blacksmith\\nas i or better\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou are one of those biddyâ\\x80\\x9d said i â\\x80\\x9cwho make the most of every\\nchance you never had a chance before you came here and see how\\nimproved you areâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nbiddy looked at me for an instant and went on with her sewing â\\x80\\x9ci was\\nyour first teacher though wasnâ\\x80\\x99t iâ\\x80\\x9d said she as she sewed\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbiddyâ\\x80\\x9d i exclaimed in amazement â\\x80\\x9cwhy you are cryingâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cno i am notâ\\x80\\x9d said biddy looking up and laughing â\\x80\\x9cwhat put that in\\nyour headâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nwhat could have put it in my head but the glistening of a tear as it\\ndropped on her work i sat silent recalling what a drudge she had been\\nuntil mr wopsleâ\\x80\\x99s greataunt successfully overcame that bad habit of\\nliving so highly desirable to be got rid of by some people i recalled\\nthe hopeless circumstances by which she had been surrounded in the\\nmiserable little shop and the miserable little noisy evening school\\nwith that miserable old bundle of incompetence always to be dragged and\\nshouldered i reflected that even in those untoward times there must\\nhave been latent in biddy what was now developing for in my first\\nuneasiness and discontent i had turned to her for help as a matter of\\ncourse biddy sat quietly sewing shedding no more tears and while i\\nlooked at her and thought about it all it occurred to me that perhaps\\ni had not been sufficiently grateful to biddy i might have been too\\nreserved and should have patronised her more though i did not use\\nthat precise word in my meditations with my confidence\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyes biddyâ\\x80\\x9d i observed when i had done turning it over â\\x80\\x9cyou were my\\nfirst teacher and that at a time when we little thought of ever being\\ntogether like this in this kitchenâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cah poor thingâ\\x80\\x9d replied biddy it was like her selfforgetfulness to\\ntransfer the remark to my sister and to get up and be busy about her\\nmaking her more comfortable â\\x80\\x9cthatâ\\x80\\x99s sadly trueâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwellâ\\x80\\x9d said i â\\x80\\x9cwe must talk together a little more as we used to do\\nand i must consult you a little more as i used to do let us have a\\nquiet walk on the marshes next sunday biddy and a long chatâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nmy sister was never left alone now but joe more than readily undertook\\nthe care of her on that sunday afternoon and biddy and i went out\\ntogether it was summertime and lovely weather when we had passed\\nthe village and the church and the churchyard and were out on the\\nmarshes and began to see the sails of the ships as they sailed on i\\nbegan to combine miss havisham and estella with the prospect in my\\nusual way when we came to the riverside and sat down on the bank\\nwith the water rippling at our feet making it all more quiet than it\\nwould have been without that sound i resolved that it was a good time\\nand place for the admission of biddy into my inner confidence\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbiddyâ\\x80\\x9d said i after binding her to secrecy â\\x80\\x9ci want to be a\\ngentlemanâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9co i wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t if i was youâ\\x80\\x9d she returned â\\x80\\x9ci donâ\\x80\\x99t think it would\\nanswerâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbiddyâ\\x80\\x9d said i with some severity â\\x80\\x9ci have particular reasons for\\nwanting to be a gentlemanâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou know best pip but donâ\\x80\\x99t you think you are happier as you areâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbiddyâ\\x80\\x9d i exclaimed impatiently â\\x80\\x9ci am not at all happy as i am i am\\ndisgusted with my calling and with my life i have never taken to\\neither since i was bound donâ\\x80\\x99t be absurdâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwas i absurdâ\\x80\\x9d said biddy quietly raising her eyebrows â\\x80\\x9ci am sorry\\nfor that i didnâ\\x80\\x99t mean to be i only want you to do well and to be\\ncomfortableâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwell then understand once for all that i never shall or can be\\ncomfortableâ\\x80\\x94or anything but miserableâ\\x80\\x94there biddyâ\\x80\\x94unless i can lead a\\nvery different sort of life from the life i lead nowâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthatâ\\x80\\x99s a pityâ\\x80\\x9d said biddy shaking her head with a sorrowful air\\n\\nnow i too had so often thought it a pity that in the singular kind\\nof quarrel with myself which i was always carrying on i was half\\ninclined to shed tears of vexation and distress when biddy gave\\nutterance to her sentiment and my own i told her she was right and i\\nknew it was much to be regretted but still it was not to be helped\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cif i could have settled downâ\\x80\\x9d i said to biddy plucking up the short\\ngrass within reach much as i had once upon a time pulled my feelings\\nout of my hair and kicked them into the brewery wallâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cif i could have\\nsettled down and been but half as fond of the forge as i was when i was\\nlittle i know it would have been much better for me you and i and joe\\nwould have wanted nothing then and joe and i would perhaps have gone\\npartners when i was out of my time and i might even have grown up to\\nkeep company with you and we might have sat on this very bank on a\\nfine sunday quite different people i should have been good enough for\\nyou shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t i biddyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nbiddy sighed as she looked at the ships sailing on and returned for\\nanswer â\\x80\\x9cyes i am not overparticularâ\\x80\\x9d it scarcely sounded\\nflattering but i knew she meant well\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cinstead of thatâ\\x80\\x9d said i plucking up more grass and chewing a blade\\nor two â\\x80\\x9csee how i am going on dissatisfied and uncomfortable\\nandâ\\x80\\x94what would it signify to me being coarse and common if nobody had\\ntold me soâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nbiddy turned her face suddenly towards mine and looked far more\\nattentively at me than she had looked at the sailing ships\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cit was neither a very true nor a very polite thing to sayâ\\x80\\x9d she\\nremarked directing her eyes to the ships again â\\x80\\x9cwho said itâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni was disconcerted for i had broken away without quite seeing where i\\nwas going to it was not to be shuffled off now however and i\\nanswered â\\x80\\x9cthe beautiful young lady at miss havishamâ\\x80\\x99s and sheâ\\x80\\x99s more\\nbeautiful than anybody ever was and i admire her dreadfully and i\\nwant to be a gentleman on her accountâ\\x80\\x9d having made this lunatic\\nconfession i began to throw my tornup grass into the river as if i\\nhad some thoughts of following it\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cdo you want to be a gentleman to spite her or to gain her overâ\\x80\\x9d\\nbiddy quietly asked me after a pause\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci donâ\\x80\\x99t knowâ\\x80\\x9d i moodily answered\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbecause if it is to spite herâ\\x80\\x9d biddy pursued â\\x80\\x9ci should thinkâ\\x80\\x94but\\nyou know bestâ\\x80\\x94that might be better and more independently done by\\ncaring nothing for her words and if it is to gain her over i should\\nthinkâ\\x80\\x94but you know bestâ\\x80\\x94she was not worth gaining overâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nexactly what i myself had thought many times exactly what was\\nperfectly manifest to me at the moment but how could i a poor dazed\\nvillage lad avoid that wonderful inconsistency into which the best and\\nwisest of men fall every day\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cit may be all quite trueâ\\x80\\x9d said i to biddy â\\x80\\x9cbut i admire her\\ndreadfullyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nin short i turned over on my face when i came to that and got a good\\ngrasp on the hair on each side of my head and wrenched it well all\\nthe while knowing the madness of my heart to be so very mad and\\nmisplaced that i was quite conscious it would have served my face\\nright if i had lifted it up by my hair and knocked it against the\\npebbles as a punishment for belonging to such an idiot\\n\\nbiddy was the wisest of girls and she tried to reason no more with me\\nshe put her hand which was a comfortable hand though roughened by\\nwork upon my hands one after another and gently took them out of my\\nhair then she softly patted my shoulder in a soothing way while with\\nmy face upon my sleeve i cried a littleâ\\x80\\x94exactly as i had done in the\\nbrewery yardâ\\x80\\x94and felt vaguely convinced that i was very much illused\\nby somebody or by everybody i canâ\\x80\\x99t say which\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci am glad of one thingâ\\x80\\x9d said biddy â\\x80\\x9cand that is that you have felt\\nyou could give me your confidence pip and i am glad of another thing\\nand that is that of course you know you may depend upon my keeping it\\nand always so far deserving it if your first teacher dear such a\\npoor one and so much in need of being taught herself had been your\\nteacher at the present time she thinks she knows what lesson she would\\nset but it would be a hard one to learn and you have got beyond her\\nand itâ\\x80\\x99s of no use nowâ\\x80\\x9d so with a quiet sigh for me biddy rose from\\nthe bank and said with a fresh and pleasant change of voice â\\x80\\x9cshall\\nwe walk a little farther or go homeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbiddyâ\\x80\\x9d i cried getting up putting my arm round her neck and giving\\nher a kiss â\\x80\\x9ci shall always tell you everythingâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ctill youâ\\x80\\x99re a gentlemanâ\\x80\\x9d said biddy\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou know i never shall be so thatâ\\x80\\x99s always not that i have any\\noccasion to tell you anything for you know everything i knowâ\\x80\\x94as i\\ntold you at home the other nightâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cahâ\\x80\\x9d said biddy quite in a whisper as she looked away at the ships\\nand then repeated with her former pleasant change â\\x80\\x9cshall we walk a\\nlittle farther or go homeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni said to biddy we would walk a little farther and we did so and the\\nsummer afternoon toned down into the summer evening and it was very\\nbeautiful i began to consider whether i was not more naturally and\\nwholesomely situated after all in these circumstances than playing\\nbeggar my neighbour by candlelight in the room with the stopped\\nclocks and being despised by estella i thought it would be very good\\nfor me if i could get her out of my head with all the rest of those\\nremembrances and fancies and could go to work determined to relish\\nwhat i had to do and stick to it and make the best of it i asked\\nmyself the question whether i did not surely know that if estella were\\nbeside me at that moment instead of biddy she would make me miserable\\ni was obliged to admit that i did know it for a certainty and i said\\nto myself â\\x80\\x9cpip what a fool you areâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nwe talked a good deal as we walked and all that biddy said seemed\\nright biddy was never insulting or capricious or biddy today and\\nsomebody else tomorrow she would have derived only pain and no\\npleasure from giving me pain she would far rather have wounded her\\nown breast than mine how could it be then that i did not like her\\nmuch the better of the two\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbiddyâ\\x80\\x9d said i when we were walking homeward â\\x80\\x9ci wish you could put\\nme rightâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci wish i couldâ\\x80\\x9d said biddy\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cif i could only get myself to fall in love with youâ\\x80\\x94you donâ\\x80\\x99t mind my\\nspeaking so openly to such an old acquaintanceâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9coh dear not at allâ\\x80\\x9d said biddy â\\x80\\x9cdonâ\\x80\\x99t mind meâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cif i could only get myself to do it that would be the thing for\\nmeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbut you never will you seeâ\\x80\\x9d said biddy\\n\\nit did not appear quite so unlikely to me that evening as it would\\nhave done if we had discussed it a few hours before i therefore\\nobserved i was not quite sure of that but biddy said she was and\\nshe said it decisively in my heart i believed her to be right and yet\\ni took it rather ill too that she should be so positive on the point\\n\\nwhen we came near the churchyard we had to cross an embankment and\\nget over a stile near a sluicegate there started up from the gate\\nor from the rushes or from the ooze which was quite in his stagnant\\nway old orlick\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9challoaâ\\x80\\x9d he growled â\\x80\\x9cwhere are you two goingâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhere should we be going but homeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwell thenâ\\x80\\x9d said he â\\x80\\x9ciâ\\x80\\x99m jiggered if i donâ\\x80\\x99t see you homeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthis penalty of being jiggered was a favourite supposititious case of\\nhis he attached no definite meaning to the word that i am aware of\\nbut used it like his own pretended christian name to affront mankind\\nand convey an idea of something savagely damaging when i was younger\\ni had had a general belief that if he had jiggered me personally he\\nwould have done it with a sharp and twisted hook\\n\\nbiddy was much against his going with us and said to me in a whisper\\nâ\\x80\\x9cdonâ\\x80\\x99t let him come i donâ\\x80\\x99t like himâ\\x80\\x9d as i did not like him either i\\ntook the liberty of saying that we thanked him but we didnâ\\x80\\x99t want\\nseeing home he received that piece of information with a yell of\\nlaughter and dropped back but came slouching after us at a little\\ndistance\\n\\ncurious to know whether biddy suspected him of having had a hand in\\nthat murderous attack of which my sister had never been able to give\\nany account i asked her why she did not like him\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cohâ\\x80\\x9d she replied glancing over her shoulder as he slouched after us\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbecause iâ\\x80\\x94i am afraid he likes meâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cdid he ever tell you he liked youâ\\x80\\x9d i asked indignantly\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnoâ\\x80\\x9d said biddy glancing over her shoulder again â\\x80\\x9che never told me\\nso but he dances at me whenever he can catch my eyeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nhowever novel and peculiar this testimony of attachment i did not\\ndoubt the accuracy of the interpretation i was very hot indeed upon\\nold orlickâ\\x80\\x99s daring to admire her as hot as if it were an outrage on\\nmyself\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbut it makes no difference to you you knowâ\\x80\\x9d said biddy calmly\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cno biddy it makes no difference to me only i donâ\\x80\\x99t like it i donâ\\x80\\x99t\\napprove of itâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnor i neitherâ\\x80\\x9d said biddy â\\x80\\x9cthough that makes no difference to\\nyouâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cexactlyâ\\x80\\x9d said i â\\x80\\x9cbut i must tell you i should have no opinion of\\nyou biddy if he danced at you with your own consentâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni kept an eye on orlick after that night and whenever circumstances\\nwere favourable to his dancing at biddy got before him to obscure that\\ndemonstration he had struck root in joeâ\\x80\\x99s establishment by reason of\\nmy sisterâ\\x80\\x99s sudden fancy for him or i should have tried to get him\\ndismissed he quite understood and reciprocated my good intentions as\\ni had reason to know thereafter\\n\\nand now because my mind was not confused enough before i complicated\\nits confusion fifty thousandfold by having states and seasons when i\\nwas clear that biddy was immeasurably better than estella and that the\\nplain honest working life to which i was born had nothing in it to be\\nashamed of but offered me sufficient means of selfrespect and\\nhappiness at those times i would decide conclusively that my\\ndisaffection to dear old joe and the forge was gone and that i was\\ngrowing up in a fair way to be partners with joe and to keep company\\nwith biddyâ\\x80\\x94when all in a moment some confounding remembrance of the\\nhavisham days would fall upon me like a destructive missile and\\nscatter my wits again scattered wits take a long time picking up and\\noften before i had got them well together they would be dispersed in\\nall directions by one stray thought that perhaps after all miss\\nhavisham was going to make my fortune when my time was out\\n\\nif my time had run out it would have left me still at the height of my\\nperplexities i dare say it never did run out however but was\\nbrought to a premature end as i proceed to relate\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter xviii\\n\\n\\nit was in the fourth year of my apprenticeship to joe and it was a\\nsaturday night there was a group assembled round the fire at the three\\njolly bargemen attentive to mr wopsle as he read the newspaper aloud\\nof that group i was one\\n\\na highly popular murder had been committed and mr wopsle was imbrued\\nin blood to the eyebrows he gloated over every abhorrent adjective in\\nthe description and identified himself with every witness at the\\ninquest he faintly moaned â\\x80\\x9ci am done forâ\\x80\\x9d as the victim and he\\nbarbarously bellowed â\\x80\\x9ciâ\\x80\\x99ll serve you outâ\\x80\\x9d as the murderer he gave\\nthe medical testimony in pointed imitation of our local practitioner\\nand he piped and shook as the aged turnpikekeeper who had heard\\nblows to an extent so very paralytic as to suggest a doubt regarding\\nthe mental competency of that witness the coroner in mr wopsleâ\\x80\\x99s\\nhands became timon of athens the beadle coriolanus he enjoyed\\nhimself thoroughly and we all enjoyed ourselves and were delightfully\\ncomfortable in this cosey state of mind we came to the verdict wilful\\nmurder\\n\\nthen and not sooner i became aware of a strange gentleman leaning\\nover the back of the settle opposite me looking on there was an\\nexpression of contempt on his face and he bit the side of a great\\nforefinger as he watched the group of faces\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwellâ\\x80\\x9d said the stranger to mr wopsle when the reading was done\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou have settled it all to your own satisfaction i have no doubtâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\neverybody started and looked up as if it were the murderer he looked\\nat everybody coldly and sarcastically\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cguilty of courseâ\\x80\\x9d said he â\\x80\\x9cout with it comeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9csirâ\\x80\\x9d returned mr wopsle â\\x80\\x9cwithout having the honour of your\\nacquaintance i do say guiltyâ\\x80\\x9d upon this we all took courage to unite\\nin a confirmatory murmur\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci know you doâ\\x80\\x9d said the stranger â\\x80\\x9ci knew you would i told you so\\nbut now iâ\\x80\\x99ll ask you a question do you know or do you not know that\\nthe law of england supposes every man to be innocent until he is\\nprovedâ\\x80\\x94provedâ\\x80\\x94to be guiltyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9csirâ\\x80\\x9d mr wopsle began to reply â\\x80\\x9cas an englishman myself iâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ccomeâ\\x80\\x9d said the stranger biting his forefinger at him â\\x80\\x9cdonâ\\x80\\x99t evade\\nthe question either you know it or you donâ\\x80\\x99t know it which is it to\\nbeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nhe stood with his head on one side and himself on one side in a\\nbullying interrogative manner and he threw his forefinger at mr\\nwopsleâ\\x80\\x94as it were to mark him outâ\\x80\\x94before biting it again\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnowâ\\x80\\x9d said he â\\x80\\x9cdo you know it or donâ\\x80\\x99t you know itâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ccertainly i know itâ\\x80\\x9d replied mr wopsle\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ccertainly you know it then why didnâ\\x80\\x99t you say so at first now iâ\\x80\\x99ll\\nask you another questionâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94taking possession of mr wopsle as if he\\nhad a right to himâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cdo you know that none of these witnesses have\\nyet been crossexaminedâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nmr wopsle was beginning â\\x80\\x9ci can only sayâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d when the stranger stopped\\nhim\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhat you wonâ\\x80\\x99t answer the question yes or no now iâ\\x80\\x99ll try you\\nagainâ\\x80\\x9d throwing his finger at him again â\\x80\\x9cattend to me are you aware\\nor are you not aware that none of these witnesses have yet been\\ncrossexamined come i only want one word from you yes or noâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nmr wopsle hesitated and we all began to conceive rather a poor\\nopinion of him\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ccomeâ\\x80\\x9d said the stranger â\\x80\\x9ciâ\\x80\\x99ll help you you donâ\\x80\\x99t deserve help but\\niâ\\x80\\x99ll help you look at that paper you hold in your hand what is itâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhat is itâ\\x80\\x9d repeated mr wopsle eyeing it much at a loss\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cis itâ\\x80\\x9d pursued the stranger in his most sarcastic and suspicious\\nmanner â\\x80\\x9cthe printed paper you have just been reading fromâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cundoubtedlyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cundoubtedly now turn to that paper and tell me whether it\\ndistinctly states that the prisoner expressly said that his legal\\nadvisers instructed him altogether to reserve his defenceâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci read that just nowâ\\x80\\x9d mr wopsle pleaded\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnever mind what you read just now sir i donâ\\x80\\x99t ask you what you read\\njust now you may read the lordâ\\x80\\x99s prayer backwards if you likeâ\\x80\\x94and\\nperhaps have done it before today turn to the paper no no no my\\nfriend not to the top of the column you know better than that to the\\nbottom to the bottomâ\\x80\\x9d we all began to think mr wopsle full of\\nsubterfuge â\\x80\\x9cwell have you found itâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9chere it isâ\\x80\\x9d said mr wopsle\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnow follow that passage with your eye and tell me whether it\\ndistinctly states that the prisoner expressly said that he was\\ninstructed by his legal advisers wholly to reserve his defence come\\ndo you make that of itâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nmr wopsle answered â\\x80\\x9cthose are not the exact wordsâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnot the exact wordsâ\\x80\\x9d repeated the gentleman bitterly â\\x80\\x9cis that the\\nexact substanceâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyesâ\\x80\\x9d said mr wopsle\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyesâ\\x80\\x9d repeated the stranger looking round at the rest of the company\\nwith his right hand extended towards the witness wopsle â\\x80\\x9cand now i\\nask you what you say to the conscience of that man who with that\\npassage before his eyes can lay his head upon his pillow after having\\npronounced a fellowcreature guilty unheardâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nwe all began to suspect that mr wopsle was not the man we had thought\\nhim and that he was beginning to be found out\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cand that same man rememberâ\\x80\\x9d pursued the gentleman throwing his\\nfinger at mr wopsle heavilyâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cthat same man might be summoned as a\\njuryman upon this very trial and having thus deeply committed\\nhimself might return to the bosom of his family and lay his head upon\\nhis pillow after deliberately swearing that he would well and truly\\ntry the issue joined between our sovereign lord the king and the\\nprisoner at the bar and would a true verdict give according to the\\nevidence so help him godâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nwe were all deeply persuaded that the unfortunate wopsle had gone too\\nfar and had better stop in his reckless career while there was yet\\ntime\\n\\nthe strange gentleman with an air of authority not to be disputed and\\nwith a manner expressive of knowing something secret about every one of\\nus that would effectually do for each individual if he chose to\\ndisclose it left the back of the settle and came into the space\\nbetween the two settles in front of the fire where he remained\\nstanding his left hand in his pocket and he biting the forefinger of\\nhis right\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cfrom information i have receivedâ\\x80\\x9d said he looking round at us as we\\nall quailed before him â\\x80\\x9ci have reason to believe there is a blacksmith\\namong you by name josephâ\\x80\\x94or joeâ\\x80\\x94gargery which is the manâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9chere is the manâ\\x80\\x9d said joe\\n\\nthe strange gentleman beckoned him out of his place and joe went\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou have an apprenticeâ\\x80\\x9d pursued the stranger â\\x80\\x9ccommonly known as pip\\nis he hereâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci am hereâ\\x80\\x9d i cried\\n\\nthe stranger did not recognise me but i recognised him as the\\ngentleman i had met on the stairs on the occasion of my second visit\\nto miss havisham i had known him the moment i saw him looking over the\\nsettle and now that i stood confronting him with his hand upon my\\nshoulder i checked off again in detail his large head his dark\\ncomplexion his deepset eyes his bushy black eyebrows his large\\nwatchchain his strong black dots of beard and whisker and even the\\nsmell of scented soap on his great hand\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci wish to have a private conference with you twoâ\\x80\\x9d said he when he\\nhad surveyed me at his leisure â\\x80\\x9cit will take a little time perhaps we\\nhad better go to your place of residence i prefer not to anticipate my\\ncommunication here you will impart as much or as little of it as you\\nplease to your friends afterwards i have nothing to do with thatâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\namidst a wondering silence we three walked out of the jolly bargemen\\nand in a wondering silence walked home while going along the strange\\ngentleman occasionally looked at me and occasionally bit the side of\\nhis finger as we neared home joe vaguely acknowledging the occasion\\nas an impressive and ceremonious one went on ahead to open the front\\ndoor our conference was held in the state parlour which was feebly\\nlighted by one candle\\n\\nit began with the strange gentlemanâ\\x80\\x99s sitting down at the table\\ndrawing the candle to him and looking over some entries in his\\npocketbook he then put up the pocketbook and set the candle a little\\naside after peering round it into the darkness at joe and me to\\nascertain which was which\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmy nameâ\\x80\\x9d he said â\\x80\\x9cis jaggers and i am a lawyer in london i am\\npretty well known i have unusual business to transact with you and i\\ncommence by explaining that it is not of my originating if my advice\\nhad been asked i should not have been here it was not asked and you\\nsee me here what i have to do as the confidential agent of another i\\ndo no less no moreâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nfinding that he could not see us very well from where he sat he got\\nup and threw one leg over the back of a chair and leaned upon it thus\\nhaving one foot on the seat of the chair and one foot on the ground\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnow joseph gargery i am the bearer of an offer to relieve you of\\nthis young fellow your apprentice you would not object to cancel his\\nindentures at his request and for his good you would want nothing for\\nso doingâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9clord forbid that i should want anything for not standing in pipâ\\x80\\x99s\\nwayâ\\x80\\x9d said joe staring\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9clord forbidding is pious but not to the purposeâ\\x80\\x9d returned mr\\njaggers â\\x80\\x9cthe question is would you want anything do you want\\nanythingâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthe answer isâ\\x80\\x9d returned joe sternly â\\x80\\x9cnoâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni thought mr jaggers glanced at joe as if he considered him a fool\\nfor his disinterestedness but i was too much bewildered between\\nbreathless curiosity and surprise to be sure of it\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cvery wellâ\\x80\\x9d said mr jaggers â\\x80\\x9crecollect the admission you have made\\nand donâ\\x80\\x99t try to go from it presentlyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhoâ\\x80\\x99s agoing to tryâ\\x80\\x9d retorted joe\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci donâ\\x80\\x99t say anybody is do you keep a dogâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyes i do keep a dogâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbear in mind then that brag is a good dog but holdfast is a better\\nbear that in mind will youâ\\x80\\x9d repeated mr jaggers shutting his eyes\\nand nodding his head at joe as if he were forgiving him something\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnow i return to this young fellow and the communication i have got\\nto make is that he has great expectationsâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\njoe and i gasped and looked at one another\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci am instructed to communicate to himâ\\x80\\x9d said mr jaggers throwing his\\nfinger at me sideways â\\x80\\x9cthat he will come into a handsome property\\nfurther that it is the desire of the present possessor of that\\nproperty that he be immediately removed from his present sphere of\\nlife and from this place and be brought up as a gentlemanâ\\x80\\x94in a word\\nas a young fellow of great expectationsâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nmy dream was out my wild fancy was surpassed by sober reality miss\\nhavisham was going to make my fortune on a grand scale\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnow mr pipâ\\x80\\x9d pursued the lawyer â\\x80\\x9ci address the rest of what i have\\nto say to you you are to understand first that it is the request of\\nthe person from whom i take my instructions that you always bear the\\nname of pip you will have no objection i dare say to your great\\nexpectations being encumbered with that easy condition but if you have\\nany objection this is the time to mention itâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nmy heart was beating so fast and there was such a singing in my ears\\nthat i could scarcely stammer i had no objection\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci should think not now you are to understand secondly mr pip that\\nthe name of the person who is your liberal benefactor remains a\\nprofound secret until the person chooses to reveal it i am empowered\\nto mention that it is the intention of the person to reveal it at first\\nhand by word of mouth to yourself when or where that intention

that i had no objection\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci should think not now mr pip i have done with stipulationsâ\\x80\\x9d\\nthough he called me mr pip and began rather to make up to me he\\nstill could not get rid of a certain air of bullying suspicion and\\neven now he occasionally shut his eyes and threw his finger at me while\\nhe spoke as much as to express that he knew all kinds of things to my\\ndisparagement if he only chose to mention them â\\x80\\x9cwe come next to mere\\ndetails of arrangement you must know that although i have used the\\nterm â\\x80\\x98expectationsâ\\x80\\x99 more

brideâ\\x80\\x99s table\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou know the nameâ\\x80\\x9d said mr jaggers looking shrewdly at me and then\\nshutting up his eyes while he waited for my answer\\n\\nmy answer was that i had heard of the name\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cohâ\\x80\\x9d said he â\\x80\\x9cyou have heard of the name but the question is what\\ndo you say of itâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni said or tried to say that i was much obliged to him for his\\nrecommendationâ\\x80\\x94\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cno my young friendâ\\x80\\x9d he interrupted shaking his great head very\\nslowly â\\x80\\x9crecollect yourselfâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nnot recollecting myself i began again that i was much obliged to him\\nfor his recommendationâ\\x80\\x94\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cno my young friendâ\\x80\\x9d he interrupted shaking his head and frowning\\nand smiling both at onceâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cno no no itâ\\x80\\x99s very well done but it\\nwonâ\\x80\\x99t do you are too young to fix me with it recommendation is not\\nthe word mr pip try

in london when\\nwill you come to londonâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni said glancing at joe who stood looking on motionless that i\\nsupposed i could come directly\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cfirstâ\\x80\\x9d said mr jaggers â\\x80\\x9cyou should have some new clothes to come\\nin and they should not be workingclothes say this day week youâ\\x80\\x99ll\\nwant some money shall i leave you twenty guineasâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nhe produced a long purse with the greatest coolness and counted them\\nout on the table and pushed them over to me this was the first time he\\nhad taken his leg from the chair he sat astride of the chair when he\\nhad pushed the money over and sat swinging his purse and eyeing joe\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwell joseph gargery you look dumbfounderedâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci amâ\\x80\\x9d said joe in a very decided manner\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cit was understood that you wanted nothing for yourself rememberâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cit were understoodâ\\x80\\x9d said joe â\\x80\\x9cand it are understood and it ever\\nwill be similar accordingâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbut whatâ\\x80\\x9d said mr jaggers swinging his purseâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cwhat if it was in my\\ninstructions to make you a present as compensationâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cas compensation what forâ\\x80\\x9d joe demanded\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cfor the loss of his servicesâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\njoe laid his hand upon my shoulder with the touch of a woman i have\\noften thought him since like the steamhammer that can crush a man or\\npat an eggshell in his combination of strength with gentleness â\\x80\\x9cpip\\nis that hearty welcomeâ\\x80\\x9d said joe â\\x80\\x9cto go free with his services to\\nhonour and fortunâ\\x80\\x99 as no words can tell him but if you think as money\\ncan make compensation to me for the loss of the little childâ\\x80\\x94what come\\nto the forgeâ\\x80\\x94and ever the best of friendsâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\no dear good joe whom i was so ready to leave and so unthankful to i\\nsee you again with your muscular blacksmithâ\\x80\\x99s arm before your eyes\\nand your broad chest heaving and your voice dying away o dear good\\nfaithful tender joe i feel the loving tremble of your hand upon my\\narm as solemnly this day as if it had been the rustle of an angelâ\\x80\\x99s\\nwing\\n\\nbut i encouraged joe at the time i was lost in the mazes of my future\\nfortunes and could not retrace the bypaths we had trodden together i\\nbegged joe to be comforted for as he said we had ever been the best\\nof friends and as i said we ever would be so joe scooped his eyes\\nwith his disengaged wrist as if he were bent on gouging himself but\\nsaid not another word\\n\\nmr jaggers had looked on at this as one who recognised in joe the\\nvillage idiot and in me his keeper when it was over he said\\nweighing in his hand the purse he had ceased to swingâ\\x80\\x94\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnow joseph gargery i warn you this is your last chance no half\\nmeasures with me if you mean to take a present that i have it in\\ncharge to make you speak out and you shall have it if on the\\ncontrary you mean to sayâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d here to his great amazement he was stopped\\nby joeâ\\x80\\x99s suddenly working round him with every demonstration of a fell\\npugilistic purpose\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhich i meantersayâ\\x80\\x9d cried joe â\\x80\\x9cthat if you come into my place\\nbullbaiting and badgering me come out which i meantersay as sech if\\nyouâ\\x80\\x99re a man come on which i meantersay that what i say i meantersay\\nand stand or fall byâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni drew joe away and he immediately became placable merely stating to\\nme in an obliging manner and as a polite expostulatory notice to any\\none whom it might happen to concern that he were not agoing to be\\nbullbaited and badgered in his own place mr jaggers had risen when\\njoe demonstrated and had backed near the door without evincing any\\ninclination to come in again he there delivered his valedictory\\nremarks they were these\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwell mr pip i think the sooner you leave hereâ\\x80\\x94as you are to be a\\ngentlemanâ\\x80\\x94the better let it stand for this day week and you shall\\nreceive my printed address in the meantime you can take a\\nhackneycoach at the stagecoach office in london and come straight to\\nme understand that i express no opinion one way or other on the\\ntrust i undertake i am paid for undertaking it and i do so now\\nunderstand that finally understand thatâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nhe was throwing his finger at both of us and i think would have gone\\non but for his seeming to think joe dangerous and going off\\n\\nsomething came into my head which induced me to run after him as he\\nwas going down to the jolly bargemen where he had left a hired\\ncarriage\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci beg your pardon mr jaggersâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9challoaâ\\x80\\x9d said he facing round â\\x80\\x9cwhatâ\\x80\\x99s the matterâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci wish to be quite right mr jaggers and to keep to your directions\\nso i thought i had better ask would there be any objection to my\\ntaking leave of any one i know about here before i go awayâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnoâ\\x80\\x9d said he looking as if he hardly understood me\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci donâ\\x80\\x99t mean in the village only but up townâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnoâ\\x80\\x9d said he â\\x80\\x9cno objectionâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni thanked him and ran home again and there i found that joe had\\nalready locked the front door and vacated the state parlour and was\\nseated by the kitchen fire with a hand on each knee gazing intently at\\nthe burning coals i too sat down before the fire and gazed at the\\ncoals and nothing was said for a long time\\n\\nmy sister was in her cushioned chair in her corner and biddy sat at\\nher needlework before the fire and joe sat next biddy and i sat next\\njoe in the corner opposite my sister the more i looked into the\\nglowing coals the more incapable i became of looking at joe the\\nlonger the silence lasted the more unable i felt to speak\\n\\nat length i got out â\\x80\\x9cjoe have you told biddyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cno pipâ\\x80\\x9d returned joe still looking at the fire and holding his\\nknees tight as if he had private information that they intended to\\nmake off somewhere â\\x80\\x9cwhich i left it to yourself pipâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci would rather you told joeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cpipâ\\x80\\x99s a gentleman of fortunâ\\x80\\x99 thenâ\\x80\\x9d said joe â\\x80\\x9cand god bless him in\\nitâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nbiddy dropped her work and looked at me joe held his knees and looked\\nat me i looked at both of them after a pause they both heartily\\ncongratulated me but there was a certain touch of sadness in their\\ncongratulations that i rather resented\\n\\ni took it upon myself to impress biddy and through biddy joe with\\nthe grave obligation i considered my friends under to know nothing and\\nsay nothing about the maker of my fortune it would all come out in\\ngood time i observed and in the meanwhile nothing was to be said\\nsave that i had come into great expectations from a mysterious patron\\nbiddy nodded her head thoughtfully at the fire as she took up her work\\nagain and said she would be very particular and joe still detaining\\nhis knees said â\\x80\\x9cay ay iâ\\x80\\x99ll be ekervally partickler pipâ\\x80\\x9d and then\\nthey congratulated me again and went on to express so much wonder at\\nthe notion of my being a gentleman that i didnâ\\x80\\x99t half like it\\n\\ninfinite pains were then taken by biddy to convey to my sister some\\nidea of what had happened to the best of my belief those efforts\\nentirely failed she laughed and nodded her head a great many times\\nand even repeated after biddy the words â\\x80\\x9cpipâ\\x80\\x9d and â\\x80\\x9cpropertyâ\\x80\\x9d but i\\ndoubt if they had more meaning in them than an election cry and i\\ncannot suggest a darker picture of her state of mind\\n\\ni never could have believed it without experience but as joe and biddy\\nbecame more at their cheerful ease again i became quite gloomy\\ndissatisfied with my fortune of course i could not be but it is\\npossible that i may have been without quite knowing it dissatisfied\\nwith myself\\n\\nanyhow i sat with my elbow on my knee and my face upon my hand\\nlooking into the fire as those two talked about my going away and\\nabout what they should do without me and all that and whenever i\\ncaught one of them looking at me though never so pleasantly and they\\noften looked at meâ\\x80\\x94particularly biddy i felt offended as if they\\nwere expressing some mistrust of me though heaven knows they never did\\nby word or sign\\n\\nat those times i would get up and look out at the door for our kitchen\\ndoor opened at once upon the night and stood open on summer evenings\\nto air the room the very stars to which i then raised my eyes i am\\nafraid i took to be but poor and humble stars for glittering on the\\nrustic objects among which i had passed my life\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9csaturday nightâ\\x80\\x9d said i when we sat at our supper of bread and cheese\\nand beer â\\x80\\x9cfive more days and then the day before the day theyâ\\x80\\x99ll\\nsoon goâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyes pipâ\\x80\\x9d observed joe whose voice sounded hollow in his beermug\\nâ\\x80\\x9ctheyâ\\x80\\x99ll soon goâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9csoon soon goâ\\x80\\x9d said biddy\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci have been thinking joe that when i go down town on monday and\\norder my new clothes i shall tell the tailor that iâ\\x80\\x99ll come and put\\nthem on there or that iâ\\x80\\x99ll have them sent to mr pumblechookâ\\x80\\x99s it\\nwould be very disagreeable to be stared at by all the people hereâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmr and mrs hubble might like to see you in your new genteel figure\\ntoo pipâ\\x80\\x9d said joe industriously cutting his bread with his cheese\\non it in the palm of his left hand and glancing at my untasted supper\\nas if he thought of the time when we used to compare slices â\\x80\\x9cso might\\nwopsle and the jolly bargemen might take it as a complimentâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthatâ\\x80\\x99s just what i donâ\\x80\\x99t want joe they would make such a business of\\nitâ\\x80\\x94such a coarse and common businessâ\\x80\\x94that i couldnâ\\x80\\x99t bear myselfâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cah that indeed pipâ\\x80\\x9d said joe â\\x80\\x9cif you couldnâ\\x80\\x99t abear yourselfâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nbiddy asked me here as she sat holding my sisterâ\\x80\\x99s plate â\\x80\\x9chave you\\nthought about when youâ\\x80\\x99ll show yourself to mr gargery and your sister\\nand me you will show yourself to us wonâ\\x80\\x99t youâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbiddyâ\\x80\\x9d i returned with some resentment â\\x80\\x9cyou are so exceedingly quick\\nthat itâ\\x80\\x99s difficult to keep up with youâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cshe always were quickâ\\x80\\x9d observed joe\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cif you had waited another moment biddy you would have heard me say\\nthat i shall bring my clothes here in a bundle one eveningâ\\x80\\x94most likely\\non the evening before i go awayâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nbiddy said no more handsomely forgiving her i soon exchanged an\\naffectionate good night with her and joe and went up to bed when i\\ngot into my little room i sat down and took a long look at it as a\\nmean little room that i should soon be parted from and raised above\\nfor ever it was furnished with fresh young remembrances too and even\\nat the same moment i fell into much the same confused division of mind\\nbetween it and the better rooms to which i was going as i had been in\\nso often between the forge and miss havishamâ\\x80\\x99s and biddy and estella\\n\\nthe sun had been shining brightly all day on the roof of my attic and\\nthe room was warm as i put the window open and stood looking out i\\nsaw joe come slowly forth at the dark door below and take a turn or\\ntwo in the air and then i saw biddy come and bring him a pipe and\\nlight it for him he never smoked so late and it seemed to hint to me\\nthat he wanted comforting for some reason or other\\n\\nhe presently stood at the door immediately beneath me smoking his\\npipe and biddy stood there too quietly talking to him and i knew\\nthat they talked of me for i heard my name mentioned in an endearing\\ntone by both of them more than once i would not have listened for\\nmore if i could have heard more so i drew away from the window and\\nsat down in my one chair by the bedside feeling it very sorrowful and\\nstrange that this first night of my bright fortunes should be the\\nloneliest i had ever known\\n\\nlooking towards the open window i saw light wreaths from joeâ\\x80\\x99s pipe\\nfloating there and i fancied it was like a blessing from joeâ\\x80\\x94not\\nobtruded on me or paraded before me but pervading the air we shared\\ntogether i put my light out and crept into bed and it was an uneasy\\nbed now and i never slept the old sound sleep in it any more\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter xix\\n\\n\\nmorning made a considerable difference in my general prospect of life\\nand brightened it so much that it scarcely seemed the same what lay\\nheaviest on my mind was the consideration that six days intervened\\nbetween me and the day of departure for i could not divest myself of a\\nmisgiving that something might happen to london in the meanwhile and\\nthat when i got there it would be either greatly deteriorated or\\nclean gone\\n\\njoe and biddy were very sympathetic and pleasant when i spoke of our\\napproaching separation but they only referred to it when i did after\\nbreakfast joe brought out my indentures from the press in the best\\nparlour and we put them in the fire and i felt that i was free with\\nall the novelty of my emancipation on me i went to church with joe\\nand thought perhaps the clergyman wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t have read that about the\\nrich man and the kingdom of heaven if he had known all\\n\\nafter our early dinner i strolled out alone purposing to finish off\\nthe marshes at once and get them done with as i passed the church i\\nfelt as i had felt during service in the morning a sublime compassion\\nfor the poor creatures who were destined to go there sunday after\\nsunday all their lives through and to lie obscurely at last among the\\nlow green mounds i promised myself that i would do something for them\\none of these days and formed a plan in outline for bestowing a dinner\\nof roastbeef and plumpudding a pint of ale and a gallon of\\ncondescension upon everybody in the village\\n\\nif i had often thought before with something allied to shame of my\\ncompanionship with the fugitive whom i had once seen limping among\\nthose graves what were my thoughts on this sunday when the place\\nrecalled the wretch ragged and shivering with his felon iron and\\nbadge my comfort was that it happened a long time ago and that he\\nhad doubtless been transported a long way off and that he was dead to\\nme and might be veritably dead into the bargain\\n\\nno more low wet grounds no more dikes and sluices no more of these\\ngrazing cattleâ\\x80\\x94though they seemed in their dull manner to wear a\\nmore respectful air now and to face round in order that they might\\nstare as long as possible at the possessor of such great\\nexpectationsâ\\x80\\x94farewell monotonous acquaintances of my childhood\\nhenceforth i was for london and greatness not for smithâ\\x80\\x99s work in\\ngeneral and for you i made my exultant way to the old battery and\\nlying down there to consider the question whether miss havisham\\nintended me for estella fell asleep\\n\\nwhen i awoke i was much surprised to find joe sitting beside me\\nsmoking his pipe he greeted me with a cheerful smile on my opening my\\neyes and saidâ\\x80\\x94\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cas being the last time pip i thought iâ\\x80\\x99d follerâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cand joe i am very glad you did soâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthankee pipâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou may be sure dear joeâ\\x80\\x9d i went on after we had shaken hands\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthat i shall never forget youâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cno no pipâ\\x80\\x9d said joe in a comfortable tone â\\x80\\x9ciâ\\x80\\x99m sure of that\\nay ay old chap bless you it were only necessary to get it well\\nround in a manâ\\x80\\x99s mind to be certain on it but it took a bit of time\\nto get it well round the change come so oncommon plump didnâ\\x80\\x99t itâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nsomehow i was not best pleased with joeâ\\x80\\x99s being so mightily secure of\\nme i should have liked him to have betrayed emotion or to have said\\nâ\\x80\\x9cit does you credit pipâ\\x80\\x9d or something of that sort therefore i made\\nno remark on joeâ\\x80\\x99s first head merely saying as to his second that the\\ntidings had indeed come suddenly but that i had always wanted to be a\\ngentleman and had often and often speculated on what i would do if i\\nwere one\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9chave you thoughâ\\x80\\x9d said joe â\\x80\\x9castonishingâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s a pity now joeâ\\x80\\x9d said i â\\x80\\x9cthat you did not get on a little more\\nwhen we had our lessons here isnâ\\x80\\x99t itâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwell i donâ\\x80\\x99t knowâ\\x80\\x9d returned joe â\\x80\\x9ciâ\\x80\\x99m so awful dull iâ\\x80\\x99m only master\\nof my own trade it were always a pity as i was so awful dull but itâ\\x80\\x99s\\nno more of a pity now than it wasâ\\x80\\x94this day twelvemonthâ\\x80\\x94donâ\\x80\\x99t you seeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nwhat i had meant was that when i came into my property and was able to\\ndo something for joe it would have been much more agreeable if he had\\nbeen better qualified for a rise in station he was so perfectly\\ninnocent of my meaning however that i thought i would mention it to\\nbiddy in preference\\n\\nso when we had walked home and had had tea i took biddy into our\\nlittle garden by the side of the lane and after throwing out in a\\ngeneral way for the elevation of her spirits that i should never\\nforget her said i had a favour to ask of her\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cand it is biddyâ\\x80\\x9d said i â\\x80\\x9cthat you will not omit any opportunity of\\nhelping joe on a littleâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9chow helping him onâ\\x80\\x9d asked biddy with a steady sort of glance\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwell joe is a dear good fellowâ\\x80\\x94in fact i think he is the dearest\\nfellow that ever livedâ\\x80\\x94but he is rather backward in some things for\\ninstance biddy in his learning and his mannersâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nalthough i was looking at biddy as i spoke and although she opened her\\neyes very wide when i had spoken she did not look at me\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9co his manners wonâ\\x80\\x99t his manners do thenâ\\x80\\x9d asked biddy plucking a\\nblackcurrant leaf\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmy dear biddy they do very well hereâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9co they do very well hereâ\\x80\\x9d interrupted biddy looking closely at\\nthe leaf in her hand\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9chear me outâ\\x80\\x94but if i were to remove joe into a higher sphere as i\\nshall hope to remove him when i fully come into my property they would\\nhardly do him justiceâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cand donâ\\x80\\x99t you think he knows thatâ\\x80\\x9d asked biddy\\n\\nit was such a very provoking question for it had never in the most\\ndistant manner occurred to me that i said snappishlyâ\\x80\\x94\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbiddy what do you meanâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nbiddy having rubbed the leaf to pieces between her handsâ\\x80\\x94and the\\nsmell of a blackcurrant bush has ever since recalled to me that\\nevening in the little garden by the side of the laneâ\\x80\\x94said â\\x80\\x9chave you\\nnever considered that he may be proudâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cproudâ\\x80\\x9d i repeated with disdainful emphasis\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9co there are many kinds of prideâ\\x80\\x9d said biddy looking full at me and\\nshaking her head â\\x80\\x9cpride is not all of one kindâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwell what are you stopping forâ\\x80\\x9d said i\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnot all of one kindâ\\x80\\x9d resumed biddy â\\x80\\x9che may be too proud to let any\\none take him out of a place that he is competent to fill and fills\\nwell and with respect to tell you the truth i think he is though it\\nsounds bold in me to say so for you must know him far better than i\\ndoâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnow biddyâ\\x80\\x9d said i â\\x80\\x9ci am very sorry to see this in you i did not\\nexpect to see this in you you are envious biddy and grudging you\\nare dissatisfied on account of my rise in fortune and you canâ\\x80\\x99t help\\nshowing itâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cif you have the heart to think soâ\\x80\\x9d returned biddy â\\x80\\x9csay so say so\\nover and over again if you have the heart to think soâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cif you have the heart to be so you mean biddyâ\\x80\\x9d said i in a\\nvirtuous and superior tone â\\x80\\x9cdonâ\\x80\\x99t put it off upon me i am very sorry\\nto see it and itâ\\x80\\x99s aâ\\x80\\x94itâ\\x80\\x99s a bad side of human nature i did intend to\\nask you to use any little opportunities you might have after i was\\ngone of improving dear joe but after this i ask you nothing i am\\nextremely sorry to see this in you biddyâ\\x80\\x9d i repeated â\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s aâ\\x80\\x94itâ\\x80\\x99s a\\nbad side of human natureâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhether you scold me or approve of meâ\\x80\\x9d returned poor biddy â\\x80\\x9cyou may\\nequally depend upon my trying to do all that lies in my power here at\\nall times and whatever opinion you take away of me shall make no\\ndifference in my remembrance of you yet a gentleman should not be\\nunjust neitherâ\\x80\\x9d said biddy turning away her head\\n\\ni again warmly repeated that it was a bad side of human nature in\\nwhich sentiment waiving its application i have since seen reason to\\nthink i was right and i walked down the little path away from biddy\\nand biddy went into the house and i went out at the garden gate and\\ntook a dejected stroll until suppertime again feeling it very\\nsorrowful and strange that this the second night of my bright\\nfortunes should be as lonely and unsatisfactory as the first\\n\\nbut morning once more brightened my view and i extended my clemency\\nto biddy and we dropped the subject putting on the best clothes i\\nhad i went into town as early as i could hope to find the shops open\\nand presented myself before mr trabb the tailor who was having his\\nbreakfast in the parlour behind his shop and who did not think it\\nworth his while to come out to me but called me in to him\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwellâ\\x80\\x9d said mr trabb in a hailfellowwellmet kind of way â\\x80\\x9chow are\\nyou and what can i do for youâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nmr trabb had sliced his hot roll into three featherbeds and was\\nslipping butter in between the blankets and covering it up he was a\\nprosperous old bachelor and his open window looked into a prosperous\\nlittle garden and orchard and there was a prosperous iron safe let\\ninto the wall at the side of his fireplace and i did not doubt that\\nheaps of his prosperity were put away in it in bags\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmr trabbâ\\x80\\x9d said i â\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s an unpleasant thing to have to mention\\nbecause it looks like boasting but i have come into a handsome\\npropertyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\na change passed over mr trabb he forgot the butter in bed got up\\nfrom the bedside and wiped his fingers on the tablecloth exclaiming\\nâ\\x80\\x9clord bless my soulâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci am going up to my guardian in londonâ\\x80\\x9d said i casually drawing some\\nguineas out of my pocket and looking at them â\\x80\\x9cand i want a fashionable\\nsuit of clothes to go in i wish to pay for themâ\\x80\\x9d i addedâ\\x80\\x94otherwise i\\nthought he might only pretend to make them â\\x80\\x9cwith ready moneyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmy dear sirâ\\x80\\x9d said mr trabb as he respectfully bent his body opened\\nhis arms and took the liberty of touching me on the outside of each\\nelbow â\\x80\\x9cdonâ\\x80\\x99t hurt me by mentioning that may i venture to congratulate\\nyou would you do me the favour of stepping into the shopâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nmr trabbâ\\x80\\x99s boy was the most audacious boy in all that countryside\\nwhen i had entered he was sweeping the shop and he had sweetened his\\nlabours by sweeping over me he was still sweeping when i came out into\\nthe shop with mr trabb and he knocked the broom against all possible\\ncorners and obstacles to express as i understood it equality with\\nany blacksmith alive or dead\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9chold that noiseâ\\x80\\x9d said mr trabb with the greatest sternness â\\x80\\x9cor\\niâ\\x80\\x99ll knock your head offâ\\x80\\x94do me the favour to be seated sir now\\nthisâ\\x80\\x9d said mr trabb taking down a roll of cloth and tiding it out\\nin a flowing manner over the counter preparatory to getting his hand\\nunder it to show the gloss â\\x80\\x9cis a very sweet article i can recommend\\nit for your purpose sir because it really is extra super but you\\nshall see some others give me number four youâ\\x80\\x9d to the boy and with\\na dreadfully severe stare foreseeing the danger of that miscreantâ\\x80\\x99s\\nbrushing me with it or making some other sign of familiarity\\n\\nmr trabb never removed his stern eye from the boy until he had\\ndeposited number four on the counter and was at a safe distance again\\nthen he commanded him to bring number five and number eight â\\x80\\x9cand let\\nme have none of your tricks hereâ\\x80\\x9d said mr trabb â\\x80\\x9cor you shall repent\\nit you young scoundrel the longest day you have to liveâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nmr trabb then bent over number four and in a sort of deferential\\nconfidence recommended it to me as a light article for summer wear an\\narticle much in vogue among the nobility and gentry an article that it\\nwould ever be an honour to him to reflect upon a distinguished\\nfellowtownsmanâ\\x80\\x99s if he might claim me for a fellowtownsman having\\nworn â\\x80\\x9care you bringing numbers five and eight you vagabondâ\\x80\\x9d said mr\\ntrabb to the boy after that â\\x80\\x9cor shall i kick you out of the shop and\\nbring them myselfâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni selected the materials for a suit with the assistance of mr trabbâ\\x80\\x99s\\njudgment and reentered the parlour to be measured for although mr\\ntrabb had my measure already and had previously been quite contented\\nwith it he said apologetically that it â\\x80\\x9cwouldnâ\\x80\\x99t do under existing\\ncircumstances sirâ\\x80\\x94wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t do at allâ\\x80\\x9d so mr trabb measured and\\ncalculated me in the parlour as if i were an estate and he the finest\\nspecies of surveyor and gave himself such a world of trouble that i\\nfelt that no suit of clothes could possibly remunerate him for his\\npains when he had at last done and had appointed to send the articles\\nto mr pumblechookâ\\x80\\x99s on the thursday evening he said with his hand\\nupon the parlour lock â\\x80\\x9ci know sir that london gentlemen cannot be\\nexpected to patronise local work as a rule but if you would give me a\\nturn now and then in the quality of a townsman i should greatly esteem\\nit goodmorning sir much obligedâ\\x80\\x94doorâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthe last word was flung at the boy who had not the least notion what\\nit meant but i saw him collapse as his master rubbed me out with his\\nhands and my first decided experience of the stupendous power of money\\nwas that it had morally laid upon his back trabbâ\\x80\\x99s boy\\n\\nafter this memorable event i went to the hatterâ\\x80\\x99s and the\\nbootmakerâ\\x80\\x99s and the hosierâ\\x80\\x99s and felt rather like mother hubbardâ\\x80\\x99s\\ndog whose outfit required the services of so many trades i also went\\nto the coachoffice and took my place for seven oâ\\x80\\x99clock on saturday\\nmorning it was not necessary to explain everywhere that i had come\\ninto a handsome property but whenever i said anything to that effect\\nit followed that the officiating tradesman ceased to have his attention\\ndiverted through the window by the high street and concentrated his\\nmind upon me when i had ordered everything i wanted i directed my\\nsteps towards pumblechookâ\\x80\\x99s and as i approached that gentlemanâ\\x80\\x99s\\nplace of business i saw him standing at his door\\n\\nhe was waiting for me with great impatience he had been out early with\\nthe chaisecart and had called at the forge and heard the news he had\\nprepared a collation for me in the barnwell parlour and he too ordered\\nhis shopman to â\\x80\\x9ccome out of the gangwayâ\\x80\\x9d as my sacred person passed\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmy dear friendâ\\x80\\x9d said mr pumblechook taking me by both hands when\\nhe and i and the collation were alone â\\x80\\x9ci give you joy of your good\\nfortune well deserved well deservedâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthis was coming to the point and i thought it a sensible way of\\nexpressing himself\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cto thinkâ\\x80\\x9d said mr pumblechook after snorting admiration at me for\\nsome moments â\\x80\\x9cthat i should have been the humble instrument of leading\\nup to this is a proud rewardâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni begged mr pumblechook to remember that nothing was to be ever said\\nor hinted on that point\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmy dear young friendâ\\x80\\x9d said mr pumblechook â\\x80\\x9cif you will allow me to\\ncall you soâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni murmured â\\x80\\x9ccertainlyâ\\x80\\x9d and mr pumblechook took me by both hands\\nagain and communicated a movement to his waistcoat which had an\\nemotional appearance though it was rather low down â\\x80\\x9cmy dear young\\nfriend rely upon my doing my little all in your absence by keeping\\nthe fact before the mind of josephâ\\x80\\x94josephâ\\x80\\x9d said mr pumblechook in\\nthe way of a compassionate adjuration â\\x80\\x9cjoseph josephâ\\x80\\x9d thereupon\\nhe shook his head and tapped it expressing his sense of deficiency in\\njoseph\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbut my dear young friendâ\\x80\\x9d said mr pumblechook â\\x80\\x9cyou must be hungry\\nyou must be exhausted be seated here is a chicken had round from the\\nboar here is a tongue had round from the boar hereâ\\x80\\x99s one or two\\nlittle things had round from the boar that i hope you may not despise\\nbut do iâ\\x80\\x9d said mr pumblechook getting up again the moment after he\\nhad sat down â\\x80\\x9csee afore me him as i ever sported with in his times of\\nhappy infancy and may iâ\\x80\\x94may iâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthis may i meant might he shake hands i consented and he was\\nfervent and then sat down again\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9chere is wineâ\\x80\\x9d said mr pumblechook â\\x80\\x9clet us drink thanks to fortune\\nand may she ever pick out her favourites with equal judgment and yet i\\ncannotâ\\x80\\x9d said mr pumblechook getting up again â\\x80\\x9csee afore me oneâ\\x80\\x94and\\nlikewise drink to oneâ\\x80\\x94without again expressingâ\\x80\\x94may iâ\\x80\\x94may iâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni said he might and he shook hands with me again and emptied his\\nglass and turned it upside down i did the same and if i had turned\\nmyself upside down before drinking the wine could not have gone more\\ndirect to my head\\n\\nmr pumblechook helped me to the liver wing and to the best slice of\\ntongue none of those outoftheway no thoroughfares of pork now and\\ntook comparatively speaking no care of himself at all â\\x80\\x9cah poultry\\npoultry you little thoughtâ\\x80\\x9d said mr pumblechook apostrophising the\\nfowl in the dish â\\x80\\x9cwhen you was a young fledgling what was in store\\nfor you you little thought you was to be refreshment beneath this\\nhumble roof for one asâ\\x80\\x94call it a weakness if you willâ\\x80\\x9d said mr\\npumblechook getting up again â\\x80\\x9cbut may i may iâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nit began to be unnecessary to repeat the form of saying he might so he\\ndid it at once how he ever did it so often without wounding himself\\nwith my knife i donâ\\x80\\x99t know\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cand your sisterâ\\x80\\x9d he resumed after a little steady eating â\\x80\\x9cwhich had\\nthe honour of bringing you up by hand itâ\\x80\\x99s a sad picter to reflect\\nthat sheâ\\x80\\x99s no longer equal to fully understanding the honour mayâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni saw he was about to come at me again and i stopped him\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cweâ\\x80\\x99ll drink her healthâ\\x80\\x9d said i\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cahâ\\x80\\x9d cried mr pumblechook leaning back in his chair quite flaccid\\nwith admiration â\\x80\\x9cthatâ\\x80\\x99s the way you know â\\x80\\x99em sirâ\\x80\\x9d i donâ\\x80\\x99t know who\\nsir was but he certainly was not i and there was no third person\\npresent â\\x80\\x9cthatâ\\x80\\x99s the way you know the nobleminded sir ever\\nforgiving and ever affable it mightâ\\x80\\x9d said the servile pumblechook\\nputting down his untasted glass in a hurry and getting up again â\\x80\\x9cto a\\ncommon person have the appearance of repeatingâ\\x80\\x94but may iâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nwhen he had done it he resumed his seat and drank to my sister â\\x80\\x9clet\\nus never be blindâ\\x80\\x9d said mr pumblechook â\\x80\\x9cto her faults of temper but\\nit is to be hoped she meant wellâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nat about this time i began to observe that he was getting flushed in\\nthe face as to myself i felt all face steeped in wine and smarting\\n\\ni mentioned to mr pumblechook that i wished to have my new clothes\\nsent to his house and he was ecstatic on my so distinguishing him i\\nmentioned my reason for desiring to avoid observation in the village\\nand he lauded it to the skies there was nobody but himself he\\nintimated worthy of my confidence andâ\\x80\\x94in short might he then he\\nasked me tenderly if i remembered our boyish games at sums and how we\\nhad gone together to have me bound apprentice and in effect how he\\nhad ever been my favourite fancy and my chosen friend if i had taken\\nten times as many glasses of wine as i had i should have known that he\\nnever had stood in that relation towards me and should in my heart of\\nhearts have repudiated the idea yet for all that i remember feeling\\nconvinced that i had been much mistaken in him and that he was a\\nsensible practical goodhearted prime fellow\\n\\nby degrees he fell to reposing such great confidence in me as to ask\\nmy advice in reference to his own affairs he mentioned that there was\\nan opportunity for a great amalgamation and monopoly of the corn and\\nseed trade on those premises if enlarged such as had never occurred\\nbefore in that or any other neighbourhood what alone was wanting to\\nthe realisation of a vast fortune he considered to be more capital\\nthose were the two little words more capital now it appeared to him\\npumblechook that if that capital were got into the business through\\na sleeping partner sirâ\\x80\\x94which sleeping partner would have nothing to\\ndo but walk in by self or deputy whenever he pleased and examine the\\nbooksâ\\x80\\x94and walk in twice a year and take his profits away in his\\npocket to the tune of fifty per centâ\\x80\\x94it appeared to him that that\\nmight be an opening for a young gentleman of spirit combined with\\nproperty which would be worthy of his attention but what did i think\\nhe had great confidence in my opinion and what did i think i gave it\\nas my opinion â\\x80\\x9cwait a bitâ\\x80\\x9d the united vastness and distinctness of\\nthis view so struck him that he no longer asked if he might shake\\nhands with me but said he really mustâ\\x80\\x94and did\\n\\nwe drank all the wine and mr pumblechook pledged himself over and\\nover again to keep joseph up to the mark i donâ\\x80\\x99t know what mark and\\nto render me efficient and constant service i donâ\\x80\\x99t know what\\nservice he also made known to me for the first time in my life and\\ncertainly after having kept his secret wonderfully well that he had\\nalways said of me â\\x80\\x9cthat boy is no common boy and mark me his fortunâ\\x80\\x99\\nwill be no common fortunâ\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d he said with a tearful smile that it was a\\nsingular thing to think of now and i said so too finally i went out\\ninto the air with a dim perception that there was something unwonted\\nin the conduct of the sunshine and found that i had slumberously got\\nto the turnpike without having taken any account of the road\\n\\nthere i was roused by mr pumblechookâ\\x80\\x99s hailing me he was a long way\\ndown the sunny street and was making expressive gestures for me to\\nstop i stopped and he came up breathless\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cno my dear friendâ\\x80\\x9d said he when he had recovered wind for speech\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnot if i can help it this occasion shall not entirely pass without\\nthat affability on your partâ\\x80\\x94may i as an old friend and wellwisher\\nmay iâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nwe shook hands for the hundredth time at least and he ordered a young\\ncarter out of my way with the greatest indignation then he blessed me\\nand stood waving his hand to me until i had passed the crook in the\\nroad and then i turned into a field and had a long nap under a hedge\\nbefore i pursued my way home\\n\\ni had scant luggage to take with me to london for little of the little\\ni possessed was adapted to my new station but i began packing that\\nsame afternoon and wildly packed up things that i knew i should want\\nnext morning in a fiction that there was not a moment to be lost\\n\\nso tuesday wednesday and thursday passed and on friday morning i\\nwent to mr pumblechookâ\\x80\\x99s to put on my new clothes and pay my visit to\\nmiss havisham mr pumblechookâ\\x80\\x99s own room was given up to me to dress\\nin and was decorated with clean towels expressly for the event my\\nclothes were rather a disappointment of course probably every new and\\neagerly expected garment ever put on since clothes came in fell a\\ntrifle short of the wearerâ\\x80\\x99s expectation but after i had had my new\\nsuit on some half an hour and had gone through an immensity of\\nposturing with mr pumblechookâ\\x80\\x99s very limited dressingglass in the\\nfutile endeavour to see my legs it seemed to fit me better it being\\nmarket morning at a neighbouring town some ten miles off mr\\npumblechook was not at home i had not told him exactly when i meant to\\nleave and was not likely to shake hands with him again before\\ndeparting this was all as it should be and i went out in my new\\narray fearfully ashamed of having to pass the shopman and suspicious\\nafter all that i was at a personal disadvantage something like joeâ\\x80\\x99s\\nin his sunday suit\\n\\ni went circuitously to miss havishamâ\\x80\\x99s by all the back ways and rang\\nat the bell constrainedly on account of the stiff long fingers of my\\ngloves sarah pocket came to the gate and positively reeled back when\\nshe saw me so changed her walnutshell countenance likewise turned\\nfrom brown to green and yellow\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyouâ\\x80\\x9d said she â\\x80\\x9cyou good gracious what do you wantâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci am going to london miss pocketâ\\x80\\x9d said i â\\x80\\x9cand want to say goodbye\\nto miss havishamâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni was not expected for she left me locked in the yard while she went\\nto ask if i were to be admitted after a very short delay she returned\\nand took me up staring at me all the way\\n\\nmiss havisham was taking exercise in the room with the long spread\\ntable leaning on her crutch stick the room was lighted as of yore\\nand at the sound of our entrance she stopped and turned she was then\\njust abreast of the rotted bridecake\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cdonâ\\x80\\x99t go sarahâ\\x80\\x9d she said â\\x80\\x9cwell pipâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci start for london miss havisham tomorrowâ\\x80\\x9d i was exceedingly\\ncareful what i said â\\x80\\x9cand i thought you would kindly not mind my taking\\nleave of youâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthis is a gay figure pipâ\\x80\\x9d said she making her crutch stick play\\nround me as if she the fairy godmother who had changed me were\\nbestowing the finishing gift\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci have come into such good fortune since i saw you last miss\\nhavishamâ\\x80\\x9d i murmured â\\x80\\x9cand i am so grateful for it miss havishamâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cay ayâ\\x80\\x9d said she looking at the discomfited and envious sarah with\\ndelight â\\x80\\x9ci have seen mr jaggers i have heard about it pip so you\\ngo tomorrowâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyes miss havishamâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cand you are adopted by a rich personâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyes miss havishamâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnot namedâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cno miss havishamâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cand mr jaggers is made your guardianâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyes miss havishamâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nshe quite gloated on these questions and answers so keen was her\\nenjoyment of sarah pocketâ\\x80\\x99s jealous dismay â\\x80\\x9cwellâ\\x80\\x9d she went on â\\x80\\x9cyou\\nhave a promising career before you be goodâ\\x80\\x94deserve itâ\\x80\\x94and abide by mr\\njaggersâ\\x80\\x99s instructionsâ\\x80\\x9d she looked at me and looked at sarah and\\nsarahâ\\x80\\x99s countenance wrung out of her watchful face a cruel smile\\nâ\\x80\\x9cgoodbye pipâ\\x80\\x94you will always keep the name of pip you knowâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyes miss havishamâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cgoodbye pipâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nshe stretched out her hand and i went down on my knee and put it to my\\nlips i had not considered how i should take leave of her it came\\nnaturally to me at the moment to do this she looked at sarah pocket\\nwith triumph in her weird eyes and so i left my fairy godmother with\\nboth her hands on her crutch stick standing in the midst of the dimly\\nlighted room beside the rotten bridecake that was hidden in cobwebs\\n\\nsarah pocket conducted me down as if i were a ghost who must be seen\\nout she could not get over my appearance and was in the last degree\\nconfounded i said â\\x80\\x9cgoodbye miss pocketâ\\x80\\x9d but she merely stared and\\ndid not seem collected enough to know that i had spoken clear of the\\nhouse i made the best of my way back to pumblechookâ\\x80\\x99s took off my new\\nclothes made them into a bundle and went back home in my older dress\\ncarrying itâ\\x80\\x94to speak the truthâ\\x80\\x94much more at my ease too though i had\\nthe bundle to carry\\n\\nand now those six days which were to have run out so slowly had run\\nout fast and were gone and tomorrow looked me in the face more\\nsteadily than i could look at it as the six evenings had dwindled\\naway to five to four to three to two i had become more and more\\nappreciative of the society of joe and biddy on this last evening i\\ndressed myself out in my new clothes for their delight and sat in my\\nsplendour\\t until bedtime we had a hot supper on the occasion\\ngraced by the inevitable roast fowl and we had some flip to finish\\nwith we were all very low and none the higher for pretending to be in\\nspirits\\n\\ni was to leave our village at five in the morning carrying my little\\nhandportmanteau and i had told joe that i wished to walk away all\\nalone i am afraidâ\\x80\\x94sore afraidâ\\x80\\x94that this purpose originated in my sense\\nof the contrast there would be between me and joe if we went to the\\ncoach together i had pretended with myself that there was nothing of\\nthis taint in the arrangement but when i went up to my little room on\\nthis last night i felt compelled to admit that it might be so and had\\nan impulse upon me to go down again and entreat joe to walk with me in\\nthe morning i did not\\n\\nall night there were coaches in my broken sleep going to wrong places\\ninstead of to london and having in the traces now dogs now cats now\\npigs now menâ\\x80\\x94never horses fantastic failures of journeys occupied me\\nuntil the day dawned and the birds were singing then i got up and\\npartly dressed and sat at the window to take a last look out and in\\ntaking it fell asleep\\n\\nbiddy was astir so early to get my breakfast that although i did not\\nsleep at the window an hour i smelt the smoke of the kitchen fire when\\ni started up with a terrible idea that it must be late in the\\nafternoon but long after that and long after i had heard the clinking\\nof the teacups and was quite ready i wanted the resolution to go\\ndownstairs after all i remained up there repeatedly unlocking and\\nunstrapping my small portmanteau and locking and strapping it up again\\nuntil biddy called to me that i was late\\n\\nit was a hurried breakfast with no taste in it i got up from the meal\\nsaying with a sort of briskness as if it had only just occurred to me\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwell i suppose i must be offâ\\x80\\x9d and then i kissed my sister who was\\nlaughing and nodding and shaking in her usual chair and kissed biddy\\nand threw my arms around joeâ\\x80\\x99s neck then i took up my little\\nportmanteau and walked out the last i saw of them was when i\\npresently heard a scuffle behind me and looking back saw joe throwing\\nan old shoe after me and biddy throwing another old shoe i stopped\\nthen to wave my hat and dear old joe waved his strong right arm above\\nhis head crying huskily â\\x80\\x9chooroarâ\\x80\\x9d and biddy put her apron to her\\nface\\n\\ni walked away at a good pace thinking it was easier to go than i had\\nsupposed it would be and reflecting that it would never have done to\\nhave had an old shoe thrown after the coach in sight of all the high\\nstreet i whistled and made nothing of going but the village was very\\npeaceful and quiet and the light mists were solemnly rising as if to\\nshow me the world and i had been so innocent and little there and all\\nbeyond was so unknown and great that in a moment with a strong heave\\nand sob i broke into tears it was by the fingerpost at the end of the\\nvillage and i laid my hand upon it and said â\\x80\\x9cgoodbye o my dear\\ndear friendâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nheaven knows we need never be ashamed of our tears for they are rain\\nupon the blinding dust of earth overlying our hard hearts i was\\nbetter after i had cried than beforeâ\\x80\\x94more sorry more aware of my own\\ningratitude more gentle if i had cried before i should have had joe\\nwith me then\\n\\nso subdued i was by those tears and by their breaking out again in the\\ncourse of the quiet walk that when i was on the coach and it was\\nclear of the town i deliberated with an aching heart whether i would\\nnot get down when we changed horses and walk back and have another\\nevening at home and a better parting we changed and i had not made\\nup my mind and still reflected for my comfort that it would be quite\\npracticable to get down and walk back when we changed again and while\\ni was occupied with these deliberations i would fancy an exact\\nresemblance to joe in some man coming along the road towards us and my\\nheart would beat highâ\\x80\\x94as if he could possibly be there\\n\\nwe changed again and yet again and it was now too late and too far to\\ngo back and i went on and the mists had all solemnly risen now and\\nthe world lay spread before me\\n\\nthis is the end of the first stage of pipâ\\x80\\x99s expectations\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter xx\\n\\n\\nthe journey from our town to the metropolis was a journey of about five\\nhours it was a little past midday when the fourhorse stagecoach by\\nwhich i was a passenger got into the ravel of traffic frayed out about\\nthe cross keys wood street cheapside london\\n\\nwe britons had at that time particularly settled that it was\\ntreasonable to doubt our having and our being the best of everything\\notherwise while i was scared by the immensity of london i think i\\nmight have had some faint doubts whether it was not rather ugly\\ncrooked narrow and dirty\\n\\nmr jaggers had duly sent me his address it was little britain and\\nhe had written after it on his card â\\x80\\x9cjust out of smithfield and close\\nby the coachofficeâ\\x80\\x9d nevertheless a hackneycoachman who seemed to\\nhave as many capes to his greasy greatcoat as he was years old packed\\nme up in his coach and hemmed me in with a folding and jingling barrier\\nof steps as if he were going to take me fifty miles his getting on\\nhis box which i remember to have been decorated with an old\\nweatherstained peagreen hammercloth motheaten into rags was quite a\\nwork of time it was a wonderful equipage with six great coronets\\noutside and ragged things behind for i donâ\\x80\\x99t know how many footmen to\\nhold on by and a harrow below them to prevent amateur footmen from\\nyielding to the temptation\\n\\ni had scarcely had time to enjoy the coach and to think how like a\\nstrawyard it was and yet how like a ragshop and to wonder why the\\nhorsesâ\\x80\\x99 nosebags were kept inside when i observed the coachman\\nbeginning to get down as if we were going to stop presently and stop\\nwe presently did in a gloomy street at certain offices with an open\\ndoor whereon was painted mr jaggers\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9chow muchâ\\x80\\x9d i asked the coachman\\n\\nthe coachman answered â\\x80\\x9ca shillingâ\\x80\\x94unless you wish to make it moreâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni naturally said i had no wish to make it more\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthen it must be a shillingâ\\x80\\x9d observed the coachman â\\x80\\x9ci donâ\\x80\\x99t want to\\nget into trouble i know himâ\\x80\\x9d he darkly closed an eye at mr\\njaggersâ\\x80\\x99s name and shook his head\\n\\nwhen he had got his shilling and had in course of time completed the\\nascent to his box and had got away which appeared to relieve his\\nmind i went into the front office with my little portmanteau in my\\nhand and asked was mr jaggers at home\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9che is notâ\\x80\\x9d returned the clerk â\\x80\\x9che is in court at present am i\\naddressing mr pipâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni signified that he was addressing mr pip\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmr jaggers left word would you wait in his room he couldnâ\\x80\\x99t say how\\nlong he might be having a case on but it stands to reason his time\\nbeing valuable that he wonâ\\x80\\x99t be longer than he can helpâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nwith those words the clerk opened a door and ushered me into an inner\\nchamber at the back here we found a gentleman with one eye in a\\nvelveteen suit and kneebreeches who wiped his nose with his sleeve on\\nbeing interrupted in the perusal of the newspaper\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cgo and wait outside mikeâ\\x80\\x9d said the clerk\\n\\ni began to say that i hoped i was not interrupting when the clerk\\nshoved this gentleman out with as little ceremony as i ever saw used\\nand tossing his fur cap out after him left me alone\\n\\nmr jaggersâ\\x80\\x99s room was lighted by a skylight only and was a most\\ndismal place the skylight eccentrically pitched like a broken head\\nand the distorted adjoining houses looking as if they had twisted\\nthemselves to peep down at me through it there were not so many papers\\nabout as i should have expected to see and there were some odd\\nobjects about that i should not have expected to seeâ\\x80\\x94such as an old\\nrusty pistol a sword in a scabbard several strangelooking boxes and\\npackages and two dreadful casts on a shelf of faces peculiarly\\nswollen and twitchy about the nose mr jaggersâ\\x80\\x99s own highbacked\\nchair was of deadly black horsehair with rows of brass nails round it\\nlike a coffin and i fancied i could see how he leaned back in it and\\nbit his forefinger at the clients the room was but small and the\\nclients seemed to have had a habit of backing up against the wall the\\nwall especially opposite to mr jaggersâ\\x80\\x99s chair being greasy with\\nshoulders i recalled too that the oneeyed gentleman had shuffled\\nforth against the wall when i was the innocent cause of his being\\nturned out\\n\\ni sat down in the cliental chair placed over against mr jaggersâ\\x80\\x99s\\nchair and became fascinated by the dismal atmosphere of the place i\\ncalled to mind that the clerk had the same air of knowing something to\\neverybody elseâ\\x80\\x99s disadvantage as his master had i wondered how many\\nother clerks there were upstairs and whether they all claimed to have\\nthe same detrimental mastery of their fellowcreatures i wondered what\\nwas the history of all the odd litter about the room and how it came\\nthere i wondered whether the two swollen faces were of mr jaggersâ\\x80\\x99s\\nfamily and if he were so unfortunate as to have had a pair of such\\nilllooking relations why he stuck them on that dusty perch for the\\nblacks and flies to settle on instead of giving them a place at home\\nof course i had no experience of a london summer day and my spirits\\nmay have been oppressed by the hot exhausted air and by the dust and\\ngrit that lay thick on everything but i sat wondering and waiting in\\nmr jaggersâ\\x80\\x99s close room until i really could not bear the two casts\\non the shelf above mr jaggersâ\\x80\\x99s chair and got up and went out\\n\\nwhen i told the clerk that i would take a turn in the air while i\\nwaited he advised me to go round the corner and i should come into\\nsmithfield so i came into smithfield and the shameful place being\\nall asmear with filth and fat and blood and foam seemed to stick to\\nme so i rubbed it off with all possible speed by turning into a\\nstreet where i saw the great black dome of saint paulâ\\x80\\x99s bulging at me\\nfrom behind a grim stone building which a bystander said was newgate\\nprison following the wall of the jail i found the roadway covered\\nwith straw to deaden the noise of passing vehicles and from this and\\nfrom the quantity of people standing about smelling strongly of spirits\\nand beer i inferred that the trials were on\\n\\nwhile i looked about me here an exceedingly dirty and partially drunk\\nminister of justice asked me if i would like to step in and hear a\\ntrial or so informing me that he could give me a front place for half\\na crown whence i should command a full view of the lord chief justice\\nin his wig and robesâ\\x80\\x94mentioning that awful personage like waxwork and\\npresently offering him at the reduced price of eighteenpence as i\\ndeclined the proposal on the plea of an appointment he was so good as\\nto take me into a yard and show me where the gallows was kept and also\\nwhere people were publicly whipped and then he showed me the debtorsâ\\x80\\x99\\ndoor out of which culprits came to be hanged heightening the interest\\nof that dreadful portal by giving me to understand that â\\x80\\x9cfour on â\\x80\\x99emâ\\x80\\x9d\\nwould come out at that door the day after tomorrow at eight in the\\nmorning to be killed in a row this was horrible and gave me a\\nsickening idea of london the more so as the lord chief justiceâ\\x80\\x99s\\nproprietor wore from his hat down to his boots and up again to his\\npockethandkerchief inclusive mildewed clothes which had evidently not\\nbelonged to him originally and which i took it into my head he had\\nbought cheap of the executioner under these circumstances i thought\\nmyself well rid of him for a shilling\\n\\ni dropped into the office to ask if mr jaggers had come in yet and i\\nfound he had not and i strolled out again this time i made the tour\\nof little britain and turned into bartholomew close and now i became\\naware that other people were waiting about for mr jaggers as well as\\ni there were two men of secret appearance lounging in bartholomew\\nclose and thoughtfully fitting their feet into the cracks of the\\npavement as they talked together one of whom said to the other when\\nthey first passed me that â\\x80\\x9cjaggers would do it if it was to be doneâ\\x80\\x9d\\nthere was a knot of three men and two women standing at a corner and\\none of the women was crying on her dirty shawl and the other comforted\\nher by saying as she pulled her own shawl over her shoulders â\\x80\\x9cjaggers\\nis for him â\\x80\\x99melia and what more could you haveâ\\x80\\x9d there was a\\nredeyed little jew who came into the close while i was loitering\\nthere in company with a second little jew whom he sent upon an errand\\nand while the messenger was gone i remarked this jew who was of a\\nhighly excitable temperament performing a jig of anxiety under a\\nlamppost and accompanying himself in a kind of frenzy with the\\nwords â\\x80\\x9co jaggerth jaggerth jaggerth all otherth ith cagmaggerth\\ngive me jaggerthâ\\x80\\x9d these testimonies to the popularity of my guardian\\nmade a deep impression on me and i admired and wondered more than\\never\\n\\nat length as i was looking out at the iron gate of bartholomew close\\ninto little britain i saw mr jaggers coming across the road towards\\nme all the others who were waiting saw him at the same time and there\\nwas quite a rush at him mr jaggers putting a hand on my shoulder and\\nwalking me on at his side without saying anything to me addressed\\nhimself to his followers\\n\\nfirst he took the two secret men\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnow i have nothing to say to youâ\\x80\\x9d said mr jaggers throwing his\\nfinger at them â\\x80\\x9ci want to know no more than i know as to the result\\nitâ\\x80\\x99s a tossup i told you from the first it was a tossup have you\\npaid wemmickâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwe made the money up this morning sirâ\\x80\\x9d said one of the men\\nsubmissively while the other perused mr jaggersâ\\x80\\x99s face\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci donâ\\x80\\x99t ask you when you made it up or where or whether you made it\\nup at all has wemmick got itâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyes sirâ\\x80\\x9d said both the men together\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cvery well then you may go now i wonâ\\x80\\x99t have itâ\\x80\\x9d said mr jaggers\\nwaving his hand at them to put them behind him â\\x80\\x9cif you say a word to\\nme iâ\\x80\\x99ll throw up the caseâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwe thought mr jaggersâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d one of the men began pulling off his hat\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthatâ\\x80\\x99s what i told you not to doâ\\x80\\x9d said mr jaggers â\\x80\\x9cyou thought i\\nthink for you thatâ\\x80\\x99s enough for you if i want you i know where to\\nfind you i donâ\\x80\\x99t want you to find me now i wonâ\\x80\\x99t have it i wonâ\\x80\\x99t\\nhear a wordâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthe two men looked at one another as mr jaggers waved them behind\\nagain and humbly fell back and were heard no more\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cand now youâ\\x80\\x9d said mr jaggers suddenly stopping and turning on\\nthe two women with the shawls from whom the three men had meekly\\nseparatedâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9coh amelia is

â\\x80\\x9conce for all if you donâ\\x80\\x99t\\nknow that your billâ\\x80\\x99s in good hands i know it and if you come here\\nbothering about your bill iâ\\x80\\x99ll make an example of both your

do say another\\nwordâ\\x80\\x94one single wordâ\\x80\\x94and wemmick shall give you your money backâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthis terrible threat caused the two women to fall off immediately no\\none remained now but the excitable jew who had already raised the\\nskirts of mr jaggersâ\\x80\\x99s coat to his lips several times\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci donâ\\x80\\x99t know this manâ\\x80\\x9d said mr jaggers in the

pavement as if it were red hot without further\\ninterruption we reached the front office where we found the clerk and\\nthe man in velveteen with the fur cap\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9chereâ\\x80\\x99s mikeâ\\x80\\x9d said the clerk getting down from his stool and\\napproaching mr jaggers confidentially\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cohâ\\x80\\x9d said mr jaggers turning to the man who was pulling a lock of\\nhair in the middle of his forehead like the bull in cock robin pulling\\nat the bellrope â\\x80\\x9cyour man comes on this afternoon wellâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwell masâ\\x80\\x99r jaggersâ\\x80\\x9d returned mike in the voice of a sufferer from a\\nconstitutional cold â\\x80\\x9carter a deal oâ\\x80\\x99 trouble iâ\\x80\\x99ve found one sir as\\nmight doâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhat is he prepared to swearâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwell masâ\\x80\\x99r jaggersâ\\x80\\x9d said mike wiping his nose on his fur cap this\\ntime â\\x80\\x9cin a general way anythinkâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nmr jaggers suddenly became most irate â\\x80\\x9cnow i warned you beforeâ\\x80\\x9d\\nsaid he throwing his forefinger at the terrified client â\\x80\\x9cthat if you\\never presumed to talk in that way here iâ\\x80\\x99d make an example of you you\\ninfernal scoundrel how dare you tell me thatâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthe client looked scared but bewildered too as if he were unconscious\\nwhat he had done\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cspooneyâ\\x80\\x9d said the clerk in a low voice giving him a stir with his\\nelbow â\\x80\\x9csoft head need you say it face to faceâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnow i ask you you blundering boobyâ\\x80\\x9d said my guardian very sternly\\nâ\\x80\\x9conce more and for the last time what the man you have brought here is\\nprepared to swearâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nmike looked hard at my guardian as if he were trying to learn a lesson\\nfrom his face and slowly replied â\\x80\\x9cayther to character or to having\\nbeen in his company and never left him all the night in questionâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnow be careful in what station of life is this manâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nmike looked at his cap and looked at the floor and looked at the\\nceiling and looked at the clerk and even looked at me before\\nbeginning to reply in a nervous manner â\\x80\\x9cweâ\\x80\\x99ve dressed him up likeâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\nwhen my guardian blustered outâ\\x80\\x94\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhat you will will youâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cspooneyâ\\x80\\x9d added the clerk again with another stir\\n\\nafter some helpless casting about mike brightened and began againâ\\x80\\x94\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9che is dressed like a â\\x80\\x99spectable pieman a sort of a pastrycookâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cis he hereâ\\x80\\x9d asked my guardian\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci left himâ\\x80\\x9d said mike â\\x80\\x9ca setting on some doorsteps round the\\ncornerâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ctake him past that window and let me see himâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthe window indicated was the office window we all three went to it\\nbehind the wire blind and presently saw the client go by in an\\naccidental manner with a murderouslooking tall individual in a short\\nsuit of white linen and a paper cap this guileless confectioner was\\nnot by any means sober and had a black eye in the green stage of\\nrecovery which was painted over\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ctell him to take his witness away directlyâ\\x80\\x9d said my guardian to the\\nclerk in extreme disgust â\\x80\\x9cand ask him what he means by bringing such\\na fellow as thatâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nmy guardian then took me into his own room and while he lunched\\nstanding from a sandwichbox and a pocketflask of sherry he seemed\\nto bully his very sandwich as he ate it informed me what arrangements\\nhe had made for me i was to go to â\\x80\\x9cbarnardâ\\x80\\x99s innâ\\x80\\x9d to young mr\\npocketâ\\x80\\x99s rooms where a bed had been sent in for my accommodation i\\nwas to remain with young mr pocket until monday on monday i was to go\\nwith him to his fatherâ\\x80\\x99s house on a visit that i might try how i liked\\nit also i was told what my allowance was to beâ\\x80\\x94it was a very liberal\\noneâ\\x80\\x94and had handed to me from one of my guardianâ\\x80\\x99s drawers the cards\\nof certain tradesmen with whom i was to deal for all kinds of clothes\\nand such other things as i could in reason want â\\x80\\x9cyou will find your\\ncredit good mr pipâ\\x80\\x9d said my guardian whose flask of sherry smelt\\nlike a whole caskful as he hastily refreshed himself â\\x80\\x9cbut i shall by\\nthis means be able to check your bills and to pull you up if i find\\nyou outrunning the constable of course youâ\\x80\\x99ll go wrong somehow but\\nthatâ\\x80\\x99s no fault of mineâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nafter i had pondered a little over this encouraging sentiment i asked\\nmr jaggers if i could send for a coach he said it was not worth\\nwhile i was so near my destination wemmick should walk round with me\\nif i pleased\\n\\ni then found that wemmick was the clerk in the next room another clerk\\nwas rung down from upstairs to take his place while he was out and i\\naccompanied him into the street after shaking hands with my guardian\\nwe found a new set of people lingering outside but wemmick made a way\\namong them by saying coolly yet decisively â\\x80\\x9ci tell you itâ\\x80\\x99s no use he\\nwonâ\\x80\\x99t have a word to say to one of youâ\\x80\\x9d and we soon got clear of them\\nand went on side by side\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter xxi\\n\\n\\ncasting my eyes on mr wemmick as we went along to see what he was\\nlike in the light of day i found him to be a dry man rather short in\\nstature with a square wooden face whose expression seemed to have\\nbeen imperfectly chipped out with a dulledged chisel there were some\\nmarks in it that might have been dimples if the material had been\\nsofter and the instrument finer but which as it was were only dints\\nthe chisel had made three or four of these attempts at embellishment\\nover his nose but had given them up without an effort to smooth them\\noff i judged him to be a bachelor from the frayed condition of his\\nlinen and he appeared to have sustained a good many bereavements for\\nhe wore at least four mourning rings besides a brooch representing a\\nlady and a weeping willow at a tomb with an urn on it i noticed too\\nthat several rings and seals hung at his watchchain as if he were\\nquite laden with remembrances of departed friends he had glittering\\neyesâ\\x80\\x94small keen and blackâ\\x80\\x94and thin wide mottled lips he had had\\nthem to the best of my belief from forty to fifty years\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cso you were never in london beforeâ\\x80\\x9d said mr wemmick to me\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnoâ\\x80\\x9d said i\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci was new here onceâ\\x80\\x9d said mr wemmick â\\x80\\x9crum to think of nowâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou are well acquainted with it nowâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhy yesâ\\x80\\x9d said mr wemmick â\\x80\\x9ci know the moves of itâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cis it a very wicked placeâ\\x80\\x9d i asked more for the sake of saying\\nsomething than for information\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou may get cheated robbed and murdered in london but there are\\nplenty of people anywhere whoâ\\x80\\x99ll do that for youâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cif there is bad blood between you and themâ\\x80\\x9d said i to soften it off\\na little\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9co i donâ\\x80\\x99t know about bad bloodâ\\x80\\x9d returned mr wemmick â\\x80\\x9cthereâ\\x80\\x99s not\\nmuch bad blood about theyâ\\x80\\x99ll do it if thereâ\\x80\\x99s anything to be got by\\nitâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthat makes it worseâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou think soâ\\x80\\x9d returned mr wemmick â\\x80\\x9cmuch about the same i should\\nsayâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nhe wore his hat on the back of his head and looked straight before\\nhim walking in a selfcontained way as if there were nothing in the\\nstreets to claim his attention his mouth was such a postoffice of a\\nmouth that he had a mechanical appearance of smiling we had got to the\\ntop of holborn hill before i knew that it was merely a mechanical\\nappearance and that he was not smiling at all\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cdo you know where mr matthew pocket livesâ\\x80\\x9d i asked mr wemmick\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyesâ\\x80\\x9d said he nodding in the direction â\\x80\\x9cat hammersmith west of\\nlondonâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cis that farâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwell say five milesâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cdo you know himâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhy youâ\\x80\\x99re a regular crossexaminerâ\\x80\\x9d said mr wemmick looking at me\\nwith an approving air â\\x80\\x9cyes i know him i know himâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthere was an air of toleration or depreciation about his utterance of\\nthese words that rather depressed me and i was still looking sideways\\nat his block of a face in search of any encouraging note to the text\\nwhen he said here we were at barnardâ\\x80\\x99s inn my depression was not\\nalleviated by the announcement for i had supposed that establishment\\nto be an hotel kept by mr barnard to which the blue boar in our town\\nwas a mere publichouse whereas i now found barnard to be a\\ndisembodied spirit or a fiction and his inn the dingiest collection\\nof shabby buildings ever squeezed together in a rank corner as a club\\nfor tomcats\\n\\nwe entered this haven through a wicketgate and were disgorged by an\\nintroductory passage into a melancholy little square that looked to me\\nlike a flat buryingground i thought it had the most dismal trees in\\nit and the most dismal sparrows and the most dismal cats and the\\nmost dismal houses in number half a dozen or so that i had ever\\nseen i thought the windows of the sets of chambers into which those\\nhouses were divided were in every stage of dilapidated blind and\\ncurtain crippled flowerpot cracked glass dusty decay and miserable\\nmakeshift while to let to let to let glared at me from empty rooms\\nas if no new wretches ever came there and the vengeance of the soul of\\nbarnard were being slowly appeased by the gradual suicide of the\\npresent occupants and their unholy interment under the gravel a frowzy\\nmourning of soot and smoke attired this forlorn creation of barnard\\nand it had strewn ashes on its head and was undergoing penance and\\nhumiliation as a mere dusthole thus far my sense of sight while dry\\nrot and wet rot and all the silent rots that rot in neglected roof and\\ncellarâ\\x80\\x94rot of rat and mouse and bug and coachingstables near at hand\\nbesidesâ\\x80\\x94addressed themselves faintly to my sense of smell and moaned\\nâ\\x80\\x9ctry barnardâ\\x80\\x99s mixtureâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nso imperfect was this realisation of the first of my great\\nexpectations that i looked in dismay at mr wemmick â\\x80\\x9cahâ\\x80\\x9d said he\\nmistaking me â\\x80\\x9cthe retirement reminds you of the country so it does\\nmeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nhe led me into a corner and conducted me up a flight of stairsâ\\x80\\x94which\\nappeared to me to be slowly collapsing into sawdust so that one of\\nthose days the upper lodgers would look out at their doors and find\\nthemselves without the means of coming downâ\\x80\\x94to a set of chambers on\\nthe top floor mr pocket jun was painted on the door and there was\\na label on the letterbox â\\x80\\x9creturn shortlyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9che hardly thought youâ\\x80\\x99d come so soonâ\\x80\\x9d mr wemmick explained â\\x80\\x9cyou\\ndonâ\\x80\\x99t want me any moreâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cno thank youâ\\x80\\x9d said i\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cas i keep the cashâ\\x80\\x9d mr wemmick observed â\\x80\\x9cwe shall most likely meet\\npretty often good dayâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cgood dayâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni put out my hand and mr wemmick at first looked at it as if he\\nthought i wanted something then he looked at me and said correcting\\nhimselfâ\\x80\\x94\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cto be sure yes youâ\\x80\\x99re in the habit of shaking handsâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni was rather confused thinking it must be out of the london fashion\\nbut said yes\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci have got so out of itâ\\x80\\x9d said mr wemmickâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cexcept at last very\\nglad iâ\\x80\\x99m sure to make your acquaintance good dayâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nwhen we had shaken hands and he was gone i opened the staircase window\\nand had nearly beheaded myself for the lines had rotted away and it\\ncame down like the guillotine happily it was so quick that i had not\\nput my head out after this escape i was content to take a foggy view\\nof the inn through the windowâ\\x80\\x99s encrusting dirt and to stand dolefully\\nlooking out saying to myself that london was decidedly overrated\\n\\nmr pocket juniorâ\\x80\\x99s idea of shortly was not mine for i had nearly\\nmaddened myself with looking out for half an hour and had written my\\nname with my finger several times in the dirt of every pane in the\\nwindow before i heard footsteps on the stairs gradually there arose\\nbefore me the hat head neckcloth waistcoat trousers boots of a\\nmember of society of about my own standing he had a paperbag under\\neach arm and a pottle of strawberries in one hand and was out of\\nbreath\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmr pipâ\\x80\\x9d said he\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmr pocketâ\\x80\\x9d said i\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cdear meâ\\x80\\x9d he exclaimed â\\x80\\x9ci am extremely sorry but i knew there was a\\ncoach from your part of the country at midday and i thought you would\\ncome by that one the fact is i have been out on your accountâ\\x80\\x94not\\nthat that is any excuseâ\\x80\\x94for i thought coming from the country you\\nmight like a little fruit after dinner and i went to covent garden\\nmarket to get it goodâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nfor a reason that i had i felt as if my eyes would start out of my\\nhead i acknowledged his attention incoherently and began to think\\nthis was a dream\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cdear meâ\\x80\\x9d said mr pocket junior â\\x80\\x9cthis door sticks soâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nas he was fast making jam of his fruit by wrestling with the door while\\nthe paperbags were under his arms i begged him to allow me to hold\\nthem he relinquished them with an agreeable smile and combated with\\nthe door as if it were a wild beast it yielded so suddenly at last\\nthat he staggered back upon me and i staggered back upon the opposite\\ndoor and we both laughed but still i felt as if my eyes must start\\nout of my head and as if this must be a dream\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cpray come inâ\\x80\\x9d said mr pocket junior â\\x80\\x9callow me to lead the way i\\nam rather bare here but i hope youâ\\x80\\x99ll be able to make out tolerably\\nwell till monday my father thought you would get on more agreeably\\nthrough tomorrow with me than with him and might like to take a walk\\nabout london i am sure i shall be very happy to show london to you as\\nto our table you wonâ\\x80\\x99t find that bad i hope for it will be supplied\\nfrom our coffeehouse here and it is only right i should add at your\\nexpense such being mr jaggersâ\\x80\\x99s directions as to our lodging itâ\\x80\\x99s\\nnot by any means splendid because i have my own bread to earn and my\\nfather hasnâ\\x80\\x99t anything to give me and i shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t be willing to take\\nit if he had this is our sittingroomâ\\x80\\x94just such chairs and tables\\nand carpet and so forth you see as they could spare from home you\\nmustnâ\\x80\\x99t give me credit for the tablecloth and spoons and castors\\nbecause they come for you from the coffeehouse this is my little\\nbedroom rather musty but barnardâ\\x80\\x99s is musty this is your bedroom\\nthe furnitureâ\\x80\\x99s hired for the occasion but i trust it will answer the\\npurpose if you should want anything iâ\\x80\\x99ll go and fetch it the\\nchambers are retired and we shall be alone together but we shanâ\\x80\\x99t\\nfight i dare say but dear me i beg your pardon youâ\\x80\\x99re holding the\\nfruit all this time pray let me take these bags from you i am quite\\nashamedâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nas i stood opposite to mr pocket junior delivering him the bags\\none two i saw the starting appearance come into his own eyes that i\\nknew to be in mine and he said falling backâ\\x80\\x94\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9clord bless me youâ\\x80\\x99re the prowling boyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cand youâ\\x80\\x9d said i â\\x80\\x9care the pale young gentlemanâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter xxii\\n\\n\\nthe pale young gentleman and i stood contemplating one another in\\nbarnardâ\\x80\\x99s inn until we both burst out laughing â\\x80\\x9cthe idea of its being\\nyouâ\\x80\\x9d said he â\\x80\\x9cthe idea of its being youâ\\x80\\x9d said i and then we\\ncontemplated one another afresh and laughed again â\\x80\\x9cwellâ\\x80\\x9d said the\\npale young gentleman reaching out his hand goodhumouredly â\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s all\\nover now i hope and it will be magnanimous in you if youâ\\x80\\x99ll forgive\\nme for having knocked you about soâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni derived from this speech that mr herbert pocket for herbert was the\\npale young gentlemanâ\\x80\\x99s name still rather confounded his intention with\\nhis execution but i made a modest reply and we shook hands warmly\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou hadnâ\\x80\\x99t come into your good fortune at that timeâ\\x80\\x9d said herbert\\npocket\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnoâ\\x80\\x9d said i\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnoâ\\x80\\x9d he acquiesced â\\x80\\x9ci heard it had happened very lately i was\\nrather on the lookout for good fortune thenâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cindeedâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyes miss havisham had sent for me to see if she could take a fancy\\nto me but she couldnâ\\x80\\x99tâ\\x80\\x94at all events she didnâ\\x80\\x99tâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni thought it polite to remark that i was surprised to hear that\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbad tasteâ\\x80\\x9d said herbert laughing â\\x80\\x9cbut a fact yes she had sent for\\nme on a trial visit and if i had come out of it successfully i\\nsuppose i should have been provided for perhaps i should have been\\nwhatyoumaycalled it to estellaâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhatâ\\x80\\x99s thatâ\\x80\\x9d i asked with sudden gravity\\n\\nhe was arranging his fruit in plates while we talked which divided his\\nattention and was the cause of his having made this lapse of a word\\nâ\\x80\\x9caffiancedâ\\x80\\x9d he explained still busy with the fruit â\\x80\\x9cbetrothed\\nengaged whatâ\\x80\\x99shisnamed any word of that sortâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9chow did you bear your disappointmentâ\\x80\\x9d i asked\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cpoohâ\\x80\\x9d said he â\\x80\\x9ci didnâ\\x80\\x99t care much for it sheâ\\x80\\x99s a tartarâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmiss havishamâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci donâ\\x80\\x99t say no to that but i meant estella that girlâ\\x80\\x99s hard and\\nhaughty and capricious to the last degree and has been brought up by\\nmiss havisham to wreak revenge on all the male sexâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhat relation is she to miss havishamâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnoneâ\\x80\\x9d said he â\\x80\\x9conly adoptedâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhy should she wreak revenge on all the male sex what revengeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9clord mr pipâ\\x80\\x9d said he â\\x80\\x9cdonâ\\x80\\x99t you knowâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnoâ\\x80\\x9d said i\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cdear me itâ\\x80\\x99s quite a story and shall be saved till dinnertime and\\nnow let me take the liberty of asking you a question how did you come\\nthere that dayâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni told him and he was attentive until i had finished and then burst\\nout laughing again and asked me if i was sore afterwards i didnâ\\x80\\x99t ask\\nhim if he was for my conviction on that point was perfectly\\nestablished\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmr jaggers is your guardian i understandâ\\x80\\x9d he went on\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyesâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou know he is miss havishamâ\\x80\\x99s man of business and solicitor and has\\nher confidence when nobody else hasâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthis was bringing me i felt towards dangerous ground i answered with\\na constraint i made no attempt to disguise that i had seen mr jaggers\\nin miss havishamâ\\x80\\x99s house on the very day of our combat but never at\\nany other time and that i believed he had no recollection of having\\never seen me there\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9che was so obliging as to suggest my father for your tutor and he\\ncalled on my father to propose it of course he knew about my father\\nfrom his connection with miss havisham my father is miss havishamâ\\x80\\x99s\\ncousin not that that implies familiar intercourse between them for he\\nis a bad courtier and will not propitiate herâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nherbert pocket had a frank and easy way with him that was very taking\\ni had never seen any one then and i have never seen any one since who\\nmore strongly expressed to me in every look and tone a natural\\nincapacity to do anything secret and mean there was something\\nwonderfully hopeful about his general air and something that at the\\nsame time whispered to me he would never be very successful or rich i\\ndonâ\\x80\\x99t know how this was i became imbued with the notion on that first\\noccasion before we sat down to dinner but i cannot define by what\\nmeans\\n\\nhe was still a pale young gentleman and had a certain conquered\\nlanguor about him in the midst of his spirits and briskness that did\\nnot seem indicative of natural strength he had not a handsome face\\nbut it was better than handsome being extremely amiable and cheerful\\nhis figure was a little ungainly as in the days when my knuckles had\\ntaken such liberties with it but it looked as if it would always be\\nlight and young whether mr trabbâ\\x80\\x99s local work would have sat more\\ngracefully on him than on me may be a question but i am conscious\\nthat he carried off his rather old clothes much better than i carried\\noff my new suit\\n\\nas he was so communicative i felt that reserve on my part would be a\\nbad return unsuited to our years i therefore told him my small story\\nand laid stress on my being forbidden to inquire who my benefactor was\\ni further mentioned that as i had been brought up a blacksmith in a\\ncountry place and knew very little of the ways of politeness i would\\ntake it as a great kindness in him if he would give me a hint whenever\\nhe saw me at a loss or going wrong\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwith pleasureâ\\x80\\x9d said he â\\x80\\x9cthough i venture to prophesy that youâ\\x80\\x99ll\\nwant very few hints i dare say we shall be often together and i\\nshould like to banish any needless restraint between us will you do me\\nthe favour to begin at once to call me by my christian name herbertâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni thanked him and said i would i informed him in exchange that my\\nchristian name was philip\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci donâ\\x80\\x99t take to philipâ\\x80\\x9d said he smiling â\\x80\\x9cfor it sounds like a moral\\nboy out of the spellingbook who was so lazy that he fell into a pond\\nor so fat that he couldnâ\\x80\\x99t see out of his eyes or so avaricious that\\nhe locked up his cake till the mice ate it or so determined to go a\\nbirdâ\\x80\\x99snesting that he got himself eaten by bears who lived handy in\\nthe neighbourhood i tell you what i should like we are so harmonious\\nand you have been a blacksmithâ\\x80\\x94would you mind itâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t mind anything that you proposeâ\\x80\\x9d i answered â\\x80\\x9cbut i donâ\\x80\\x99t\\nunderstand youâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwould you mind handel for a familiar name thereâ\\x80\\x99s a charming piece of\\nmusic by handel called the harmonious blacksmithâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci should like it very muchâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthen my dear handelâ\\x80\\x9d said he turning round as the door opened\\nâ\\x80\\x9chere is the dinner and i must beg of you to take the top of the\\ntable because the dinner is of your providingâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthis i would not hear of so he took the top and i faced him it was a\\nnice little dinnerâ\\x80\\x94seemed to me then a very lord mayorâ\\x80\\x99s feastâ\\x80\\x94and it\\nacquired additional relish from being eaten under those independent\\ncircumstances with no old people by and with london all around us\\nthis again was heightened by a certain gypsy character that set the\\nbanquet off for while the table was as mr pumblechook might have\\nsaid the lap of luxuryâ\\x80\\x94being entirely furnished forth from the\\ncoffeehouseâ\\x80\\x94the circumjacent region of sittingroom was of a\\ncomparatively pastureless and shifty character imposing on the waiter\\nthe wandering habits of putting the covers on the floor where he fell\\nover them the melted butter in the armchair the bread on the\\nbookshelves the cheese in the coalscuttle and the boiled fowl into\\nmy bed in the next roomâ\\x80\\x94where i found much of its parsley and butter\\nin a state of congelation when i retired for the night all this made\\nthe feast delightful and when the waiter was not there to watch me my\\npleasure was without alloy\\n\\nwe had made some progress in the dinner when i reminded herbert of his\\npromise to tell me about miss havisham\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ctrueâ\\x80\\x9d he replied â\\x80\\x9ciâ\\x80\\x99ll redeem it at once let me introduce the\\ntopic handel by mentioning that in london it is not the custom to put\\nthe knife in the mouthâ\\x80\\x94for fear of accidentsâ\\x80\\x94and that while the fork\\nis reserved for that use it is not put further in than necessary it\\nis scarcely worth mentioning only itâ\\x80\\x99s as well to do as other people\\ndo also the spoon is not generally used overhand but under this\\nhas two advantages you get at your mouth better which after all is\\nthe object and you save a good deal of the attitude of opening\\noysters on the part of the right elbowâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nhe offered these friendly suggestions in such a lively way that we\\nboth laughed and i scarcely blushed\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnowâ\\x80\\x9d he pursued â\\x80\\x9cconcerning miss havisham miss havisham you must\\nknow was a spoilt child her mother died when she was a baby and her\\nfather denied her nothing her father was a country gentleman down in\\nyour part of the world and was a brewer i donâ\\x80\\x99t know why it should be\\na crack thing to be a brewer but it is indisputable that while you\\ncannot possibly be genteel and bake you may be as genteel as never was\\nand brew you see it every dayâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyet a gentleman may not keep a publichouse may heâ\\x80\\x9d said i\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnot on any accountâ\\x80\\x9d returned herbert â\\x80\\x9cbut a publichouse may keep a\\ngentleman well mr havisham was very rich and very proud so was his\\ndaughterâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmiss havisham was an only childâ\\x80\\x9d i hazarded\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cstop a moment i am coming to that no she was not an only child she\\nhad a halfbrother her father privately married againâ\\x80\\x94his cook i\\nrather thinkâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci thought he was proudâ\\x80\\x9d said i\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmy good handel so he was he married his second wife privately\\nbecause he was proud and in course of time she died when she was\\ndead i apprehend he first told his daughter what he had done and then\\nthe son became a part of the family residing in the house you are\\nacquainted with as the son grew a young man he turned out riotous\\nextravagant undutifulâ\\x80\\x94altogether bad at last his father disinherited\\nhim but he softened when he was dying and left him well off though\\nnot nearly so well off as miss havishamâ\\x80\\x94take another glass of wine\\nand excuse my mentioning that society as a body does not expect one to\\nbe so strictly conscientious in emptying oneâ\\x80\\x99s glass as to turn it\\nbottom upwards with the rim on oneâ\\x80\\x99s noseâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni had been doing this in an excess of attention to his recital i\\nthanked him and apologised he said â\\x80\\x9cnot at allâ\\x80\\x9d and resumed\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmiss havisham was now an heiress and you may suppose was looked after\\nas a great match her halfbrother had now ample means again but what\\nwith debts and what with new madness wasted them most fearfully again\\nthere were stronger differences between him and her than there had been\\nbetween him and his father and it is suspected that he cherished a\\ndeep and mortal grudge against her as having influenced the fatherâ\\x80\\x99s\\nanger now i come to the cruel part of the storyâ\\x80\\x94merely breaking off\\nmy dear handel to remark that a dinnernapkin will not go into a\\ntumblerâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nwhy i was trying to pack mine into my tumbler i am wholly unable to\\nsay i only know that i found myself with a perseverance worthy of a\\nmuch better cause making the most strenuous exertions to compress it\\nwithin those limits again i thanked him and apologised and again he\\nsaid in the cheerfullest manner â\\x80\\x9cnot at all i am sureâ\\x80\\x9d and resumed\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthere appeared upon the sceneâ\\x80\\x94say at the races or the public balls\\nor anywhere else you likeâ\\x80\\x94a certain man who made love to miss\\nhavisham i never saw him for this happened fiveandtwenty years ago\\nbefore you and i were handel but i have heard my father mention that\\nhe was a showy man and the kind of man for the purpose but that he\\nwas not to be without ignorance or prejudice mistaken for a\\ngentleman my father most strongly asseverates because it is a\\nprinciple of his that no man who was not a true gentleman at heart ever\\nwas since the world began a true gentleman in manner he says no\\nvarnish can hide the grain of the wood and that the more varnish you\\nput on the more the grain will express itself well this man pursued\\nmiss havisham closely and professed to be devoted to her i believe\\nshe had not shown much susceptibility up to that time but all the\\nsusceptibility she possessed certainly came out then and she\\npassionately loved him there is no doubt that she perfectly idolized\\nhim he practised on her affection in that systematic way that he got\\ngreat sums of money from her and he induced her to buy her brother out\\nof a share in the brewery which had been weakly left him by his\\nfather at an immense price on the plea that when he was her husband\\nhe must hold and manage it all your guardian was not at that time in\\nmiss havishamâ\\x80\\x99s counsels and she was too haughty and too much in love\\nto be advised by any one her relations were poor and scheming with\\nthe exception of my father he was poor enough but not timeserving or\\njealous the only independent one among them he warned her that she\\nwas doing too much for this man and was placing herself too\\nunreservedly in his power she took the first opportunity of angrily\\nordering my father out of the house in his presence and my father has\\nnever seen her sinceâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni thought of her having said â\\x80\\x9cmatthew will come and see me at last\\nwhen i am laid dead upon that tableâ\\x80\\x9d and i asked herbert whether his\\nfather was so inveterate against her\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s not thatâ\\x80\\x9d said he â\\x80\\x9cbut she charged him in the presence of her\\nintended husband with being disappointed in the hope of fawning upon\\nher for his own advancement and if he were to go to her now it would\\nlook trueâ\\x80\\x94even to himâ\\x80\\x94and even to her to return to the man and make an\\nend of him the marriage day was fixed the wedding dresses were\\nbought the wedding tour was planned out the wedding guests were\\ninvited the day came but not the bridegroom he wrote her a letterâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhich she receivedâ\\x80\\x9d i struck in â\\x80\\x9cwhen she was dressing for her\\nmarriage at twenty minutes to nineâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cat the hour and minuteâ\\x80\\x9d said herbert nodding â\\x80\\x9cat which she\\nafterwards stopped all the clocks what was in it further than that it\\nmost heartlessly broke the marriage off i canâ\\x80\\x99t tell you because i\\ndonâ\\x80\\x99t know when she recovered from a bad illness that she had she\\nlaid the whole place waste as you have seen it and she has never\\nsince looked upon the light of dayâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cis that all the storyâ\\x80\\x9d i asked after considering it\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9call i know of it and indeed i only know so much through piecing it\\nout for myself for my father always avoids it and even when miss\\nhavisham invited me to go there told me no more of it than it was\\nabsolutely requisite i should understand but i have forgotten one\\nthing it has been supposed that the man to whom she gave her misplaced\\nconfidence acted throughout in concert with her halfbrother that it\\nwas a conspiracy between them and that they shared the profitsâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci wonder he didnâ\\x80\\x99t marry her and get all the propertyâ\\x80\\x9d said i\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9che may have been married already and her cruel mortification may have\\nbeen a part of her halfbrotherâ\\x80\\x99s schemeâ\\x80\\x9d said herbert â\\x80\\x9cmind i donâ\\x80\\x99t\\nknow thatâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhat became of the two menâ\\x80\\x9d i asked after again considering the\\nsubject\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthey fell into deeper shame and degradationâ\\x80\\x94if there can be deeperâ\\x80\\x94and\\nruinâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9care they alive nowâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci donâ\\x80\\x99t knowâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou said just now that estella was not related to miss havisham but\\nadopted when adoptedâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nherbert shrugged his shoulders â\\x80\\x9cthere has always been an estella\\nsince i have heard of a miss havisham i know no more and now\\nhandelâ\\x80\\x9d said he finally throwing off the story as it were â\\x80\\x9cthere is\\na perfectly open understanding between us all that i know about miss\\nhavisham you knowâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cand all that i knowâ\\x80\\x9d i retorted â\\x80\\x9cyou knowâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci fully believe it so there can be no competition or perplexity\\nbetween you and me and as to the condition on which you hold your\\nadvancement in lifeâ\\x80\\x94namely that you are not to inquire or discuss to\\nwhom you owe itâ\\x80\\x94you may be very sure that it will never be encroached\\nupon or even approached by me or by any one belonging to meâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nin truth he said this with so much delicacy that i felt the subject\\ndone with even though i should be under his fatherâ\\x80\\x99s roof for years\\nand years to come yet he said it with so much meaning too that i\\nfelt he as perfectly understood miss havisham to be my benefactress as\\ni understood the fact myself\\n\\nit had not occurred to me before that he had led up to the theme for\\nthe purpose of clearing it out of our way but we were so much the\\nlighter and easier for having broached it that i now perceived this to\\nbe the case we were very gay and sociable and i asked him in the\\ncourse of conversation what he was he replied â\\x80\\x9ca capitalistâ\\x80\\x94an\\ninsurer of shipsâ\\x80\\x9d i suppose he saw me glancing about the room in\\nsearch of some tokens of shipping or capital for he added â\\x80\\x9cin the\\ncityâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni had grand ideas of the wealth and importance of insurers of ships in\\nthe city and i began to think with awe of having laid a young insurer\\non his back blackened his enterprising eye and cut his responsible\\nhead open but again there came upon me for my relief that odd\\nimpression that herbert pocket would never be very successful or rich\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci shall not rest satisfied with merely employing my capital in\\ninsuring ships i shall buy up some good life assurance shares and cut\\ninto the direction i shall also do a little in the mining way none of\\nthese things will interfere with my chartering a few thousand tons on\\nmy own account i think i shall tradeâ\\x80\\x9d said he leaning back in his\\nchair â\\x80\\x9cto the east indies for silks shawls spices dyes drugs and\\nprecious woods itâ\\x80\\x99s an interesting tradeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cand the profits are largeâ\\x80\\x9d said i\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ctremendousâ\\x80\\x9d said he\\n\\ni wavered again and began to think here were greater expectations than\\nmy own\\n\\nillustration\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci think i shall trade alsoâ\\x80\\x9d said he putting his thumbs in his\\nwaistcoat pockets â\\x80\\x9cto the west indies for sugar tobacco and rum\\nalso to ceylon especially for elephantsâ\\x80\\x99 tusksâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou will want a good many shipsâ\\x80\\x9d said i\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ca perfect fleetâ\\x80\\x9d said he\\n\\nquite overpowered by the magnificence of these transactions i asked\\nhim where the ships he insured mostly traded to at present\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci havenâ\\x80\\x99t begun insuring yetâ\\x80\\x9d he replied â\\x80\\x9ci am looking about meâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nsomehow that pursuit seemed more in keeping with barnardâ\\x80\\x99s inn i said\\nin a tone of conviction â\\x80\\x9cahhâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyes i am in a countinghouse and looking about meâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cis a countinghouse profitableâ\\x80\\x9d i asked\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ctoâ\\x80\\x94do you mean to the young fellow whoâ\\x80\\x99s in itâ\\x80\\x9d he asked in reply\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyes to youâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhy nno not to meâ\\x80\\x9d he said this with the air of one carefully\\nreckoning up and striking a balance â\\x80\\x9cnot directly profitable that is\\nit doesnâ\\x80\\x99t pay me anything and i have toâ\\x80\\x94keep myselfâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthis certainly had not a profitable appearance and i shook my head as\\nif i would imply that it would be difficult to lay by much accumulative\\ncapital from such a source of income\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbut the thing isâ\\x80\\x9d said herbert pocket â\\x80\\x9cthat you look about you\\nthatâ\\x80\\x99s the grand thing you are in a countinghouse you know and\\nyou look about youâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nit struck me as a singular implication that you couldnâ\\x80\\x99t be out of a\\ncountinghouse you know and look about you but i silently deferred\\nto his experience\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthen the time comesâ\\x80\\x9d said herbert â\\x80\\x9cwhen you see your opening and\\nyou go in and you swoop upon it and you make your capital and then\\nthere you are when you have once made your capital you have nothing\\nto do but employ itâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthis was very like his way of conducting that encounter in the garden\\nvery like his manner of bearing his poverty too exactly corresponded\\nto his manner of bearing that defeat it seemed to me that he took all\\nblows and buffets now with just the same air as he had taken mine then\\nit was evident that he had nothing around him but the simplest\\nnecessaries for everything that i remarked upon turned out to have\\nbeen sent in on my account from the coffeehouse or somewhere else\\n\\nyet having already made his fortune in his own mind he was so\\nunassuming with it that i felt quite grateful to him for not being\\npuffed up it was a pleasant addition to his naturally pleasant ways\\nand we got on famously in the evening we went out for a walk in the\\nstreets and went halfprice to the theatre and next day we went to\\nchurch at westminster abbey and in the afternoon we walked in the\\nparks and i wondered who shod all the horses there and wished joe\\ndid\\n\\non a moderate computation it was many months that sunday since i had\\nleft joe and biddy the space interposed between myself and them\\npartook of that expansion and our marshes were any distance off that\\ni could have been at our old church in my old churchgoing clothes on\\nthe very last sunday that ever was seemed a combination of\\nimpossibilities geographical and social solar and lunar yet in the\\nlondon streets so crowded with people and so brilliantly lighted in the\\ndusk of evening there were depressing hints of reproaches for that i\\nhad put the poor old kitchen at home so far away and in the dead of\\nnight the footsteps of some incapable impostor of a porter mooning\\nabout barnardâ\\x80\\x99s inn under pretence of watching it fell hollow on my\\nheart\\n\\non the monday morning at a quarter before nine herbert went to the\\ncountinghouse to report himselfâ\\x80\\x94to look about him too i\\nsupposeâ\\x80\\x94and i bore him company he was to come away in an hour or two\\nto attend me to hammersmith and i was to wait about for him it\\nappeared to me that the eggs from which young insurers were hatched\\nwere incubated in dust and heat like the eggs of ostriches judging\\nfrom the places to which those incipient giants repaired on a monday\\nmorning nor did the countinghouse where herbert assisted show in my\\neyes as at all a good observatory being a back second floor up a yard\\nof a grimy presence in all particulars and with a look into another\\nback second floor rather than a look out\\n\\ni waited about until it was noon and i went upon â\\x80\\x99change and i saw\\nfluey men sitting there under the bills about shipping whom i took to\\nbe great merchants though i couldnâ\\x80\\x99t understand why they should all be\\nout of spirits when herbert came we went and had lunch at a\\ncelebrated house which i then quite venerated but now believe to have\\nbeen the most abject superstition in europe and where i could not help\\nnoticing even then that there was much more gravy on the tablecloths\\nand knives and waitersâ\\x80\\x99 clothes than in the steaks this collation\\ndisposed of at a moderate price considering the grease which was not\\ncharged for we went back to barnardâ\\x80\\x99s inn and got my little\\nportmanteau and then took coach for hammersmith we arrived there at\\ntwo or three oâ\\x80\\x99clock in the afternoon and had very little way to walk\\nto mr pocketâ\\x80\\x99s house lifting the latch of a gate we passed direct\\ninto a little garden overlooking the river where mr pocketâ\\x80\\x99s children\\nwere playing about and unless i deceive myself on a point where my\\ninterests or prepossessions are certainly not concerned i saw that mr\\nand mrs pocketâ\\x80\\x99s children were not growing up or being brought up but\\nwere tumbling up\\n\\nmrs pocket was sitting on a garden chair under a tree reading with\\nher legs upon another garden chair and mrs pocketâ\\x80\\x99s two nursemaids\\nwere looking about them while the children played â\\x80\\x9cmammaâ\\x80\\x9d said\\nherbert â\\x80\\x9cthis is young mr pipâ\\x80\\x9d upon which mrs pocket received me\\nwith an appearance of amiable dignity\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmaster alick and miss janeâ\\x80\\x9d cried one of the nurses to two of the\\nchildren â\\x80\\x9cif you go a bouncing up against them bushes youâ\\x80\\x99ll fall over\\ninto the river and be drownded and whatâ\\x80\\x99ll your pa say thenâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nat the same time this nurse picked up mrs pocketâ\\x80\\x99s handkerchief and\\nsaid â\\x80\\x9cif that donâ\\x80\\x99t make six times youâ\\x80\\x99ve dropped it mumâ\\x80\\x9d upon which\\nmrs pocket laughed and said â\\x80\\x9cthank you flopsonâ\\x80\\x9d and settling\\nherself in one chair only resumed her book her countenance\\nimmediately assumed a knitted and intent expression as if she had been\\nreading for a week but before she could have read half a dozen lines\\nshe fixed her eyes upon me and said â\\x80\\x9ci hope your mamma is quite\\nwellâ\\x80\\x9d this unexpected inquiry put me into such a difficulty that i\\nbegan saying in the absurdest way that if there had been any such\\nperson i had no doubt she would have been quite well and would have\\nbeen very much obliged and would have sent her compliments when the\\nnurse came to my rescue\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwellâ\\x80\\x9d she cried picking up the pockethandkerchief â\\x80\\x9cif that donâ\\x80\\x99t\\nmake seven times what are you adoing of this afternoon mumâ\\x80\\x9d mrs\\npocket received her property at first with a look of unutterable\\nsurprise as if she had never seen it before and then with a laugh of\\nrecognition and said â\\x80\\x9cthank you flopsonâ\\x80\\x9d and forgot me and went on\\nreading\\n\\ni found now i had leisure to count them that there were no fewer than\\nsix little pockets present in various stages of tumbling up i had\\nscarcely arrived at the total when a seventh was heard as in the\\nregion of air wailing dolefully\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cif there ainâ\\x80\\x99t babyâ\\x80\\x9d said flopson appearing to think it most\\nsurprising â\\x80\\x9cmake haste up millersâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nmillers who was the other nurse retired into the house and by\\ndegrees the childâ\\x80\\x99s wailing was hushed and stopped as if it were a\\nyoung ventriloquist with something in its mouth mrs pocket read all\\nthe time and i was curious to know what the book could be\\n\\nwe were waiting i supposed for mr pocket to come out to us at any\\nrate we waited there and so i had an opportunity of observing the\\nremarkable family phenomenon that whenever any of the children strayed\\nnear mrs pocket in their play they always tripped themselves up and\\ntumbled over herâ\\x80\\x94always very much to her momentary astonishment and\\ntheir own more enduring lamentation i was at a loss to account for\\nthis surprising circumstance and could not help giving my mind to\\nspeculations about it until by and by millers came down with the baby\\nwhich baby was handed to flopson which flopson was handing it to mrs\\npocket when she too went fairly head foremost over mrs pocket baby\\nand all and was caught by herbert and myself\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cgracious me flopsonâ\\x80\\x9d said mrs pocket looking off her book for a\\nmoment â\\x80\\x9ceverybodyâ\\x80\\x99s tumblingâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cgracious you indeed mumâ\\x80\\x9d returned flopson very red in the face\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhat have you got thereâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci got here flopsonâ\\x80\\x9d asked mrs pocket\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhy if it ainâ\\x80\\x99t your footstoolâ\\x80\\x9d cried flopson â\\x80\\x9cand if you keep it\\nunder your skirts like that whoâ\\x80\\x99s to help tumbling here take the\\nbaby mum and give me your bookâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nmrs pocket acted on the advice and inexpertly danced the infant a\\nlittle in her lap while the other children played about it this had\\nlasted but a very short time when mrs pocket issued summary orders\\nthat they were all to be taken into the house for a nap thus i made\\nthe second discovery on that first occasion that the nurture of the\\nlittle pockets consisted of alternately tumbling up and lying down\\n\\nunder these circumstances when flopson and millers had got the\\nchildren into the house like a little flock of sheep and mr pocket\\ncame out of it to make my acquaintance i was not much surprised to\\nfind that mr pocket was a gentleman with a rather perplexed expression\\nof face and with his very grey hair disordered on his head as if he\\ndidnâ\\x80\\x99t quite see his way to putting anything straight\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter xxiii\\n\\n\\nmr pocket said he was glad to see me and he hoped i was not sorry to\\nsee him â\\x80\\x9cfor i really am notâ\\x80\\x9d he added with his sonâ\\x80\\x99s smile â\\x80\\x9can\\nalarming personageâ\\x80\\x9d he was a younglooking man in spite of his\\nperplexities and his very grey hair and his manner seemed quite\\nnatural i use the word natural in the sense of its being unaffected\\nthere was something comic in his distraught way as though it would\\nhave been downright ludicrous but for his own perception that it was\\nvery near being so when he had talked with me a little he said to\\nmrs pocket with a rather anxious contraction of his eyebrows which\\nwere black and handsome â\\x80\\x9cbelinda i hope you have welcomed mr pipâ\\x80\\x9d\\nand she looked up from her book and said â\\x80\\x9cyesâ\\x80\\x9d she then smiled upon\\nme in an absent state of mind and asked me if i liked the taste of\\norangeflower water as the question had no bearing near or remote on\\nany foregone or subsequent transaction i consider it to have been\\nthrown out like her previous approaches in general conversational\\ncondescension\\n\\ni found out within a few hours and may mention at once that mrs\\npocket was the only daughter of a certain quite accidental deceased\\nknight who had invented for himself a conviction that his deceased\\nfather would have been made a baronet but for somebodyâ\\x80\\x99s determined\\nopposition arising out of entirely personal motivesâ\\x80\\x94i forget whose if\\ni ever knewâ\\x80\\x94the sovereignâ\\x80\\x99s the prime ministerâ\\x80\\x99s the lord\\nchancellorâ\\x80\\x99s the archbishop of canterburyâ\\x80\\x99s anybodyâ\\x80\\x99sâ\\x80\\x94and had tacked\\nhimself on to the nobles of the earth in right of this quite\\nsupposititious fact i believe he had been knighted himself for\\nstorming the english grammar at the point of the pen in a desperate\\naddress engrossed on vellum on the occasion of the laying of the first\\nstone of some building or other and for handing some royal personage\\neither the trowel or the mortar be that as it may he had directed\\nmrs pocket to be brought up from her cradle as one who in the nature\\nof things must marry a title and who was to be guarded from the\\nacquisition of plebeian domestic knowledge\\n\\nso successful a watch and ward had been established over the young lady\\nby this judicious parent that she had grown up highly ornamental but\\nperfectly helpless and useless with her character thus happily formed\\nin the first bloom of her youth she had encountered mr pocket who was\\nalso in the first bloom of youth and not quite decided whether to\\nmount to the woolsack or to roof himself in with a mitre as his doing\\nthe one or the other was a mere question of time he and mrs pocket\\nhad taken time by the forelock when to judge from its length it\\nwould seem to have wanted cutting and had married without the\\nknowledge of the judicious parent the judicious parent having nothing\\nto bestow or withhold but his blessing had handsomely settled that\\ndower upon them after a short struggle and had informed mr pocket\\nthat his wife was â\\x80\\x9ca treasure for a princeâ\\x80\\x9d mr pocket had invested\\nthe princeâ\\x80\\x99s treasure in the ways of the world ever since and it was\\nsupposed to have brought him in but indifferent interest still mrs\\npocket was in general the object of a queer sort of respectful pity\\nbecause she had not married a title while mr pocket was the object of\\na queer sort of forgiving reproach because he had never got one\\n\\nmr pocket took me into the house and showed me my room which was a\\npleasant one and so furnished as that i could use it with comfort for\\nmy own private sittingroom he then knocked at the doors of two other\\nsimilar rooms and introduced me to their occupants by name drummle\\nand startop drummle an oldlooking young man of a heavy order of\\narchitecture was whistling startop younger in years and appearance\\nwas reading and holding his head as if he thought himself in danger of\\nexploding it with too strong a charge of knowledge\\n\\nboth mr and mrs pocket had such a noticeable air of being in somebody\\nelseâ\\x80\\x99s hands that i wondered who really was in possession of the house\\nand let them live there until i found this unknown power to be the\\nservants it was a smooth way of going on perhaps in respect of\\nsaving trouble but it had the appearance of being expensive for the\\nservants felt it a duty they owed to themselves to be nice in their\\neating and drinking and to keep a deal of company downstairs they\\nallowed a very liberal table to mr and mrs pocket yet it always\\nappeared to me that by far the best part of the house to have boarded\\nin would have been the kitchenâ\\x80\\x94always supposing the boarder capable of\\nselfdefence for before i had been there a week a neighbouring lady\\nwith whom the family were personally unacquainted wrote in to say that\\nshe had seen millers slapping the baby this greatly distressed mrs\\npocket who burst into tears on receiving the note and said that it\\nwas an extraordinary thing that the neighbours couldnâ\\x80\\x99t mind their own\\nbusiness\\n\\nby degrees i learnt and chiefly from herbert that mr pocket had been\\neducated at harrow and at cambridge where he had distinguished\\nhimself but that when he had had the happiness of marrying mrs pocket\\nvery early in life he had impaired his prospects and taken up the\\ncalling of a grinder after grinding a number of dull bladesâ\\x80\\x94of whom\\nit was remarkable that their fathers when influential were always\\ngoing to help him to preferment but always forgot to do it when the\\nblades had left the grindstoneâ\\x80\\x94he had wearied of that poor work and\\nhad come to london here after gradually failing in loftier hopes he\\nhad â\\x80\\x9creadâ\\x80\\x9d with divers who had lacked opportunities or neglected them\\nand had refurbished divers others for special occasions and had turned\\nhis acquirements to the account of literary compilation and correction\\nand on such means added to some very moderate private resources still\\nmaintained the house i saw\\n\\nmr and mrs pocket had a toady neighbour a widow lady of that highly\\nsympathetic nature that she agreed with everybody blessed everybody\\nand shed smiles and tears on everybody according to circumstances\\nthis ladyâ\\x80\\x99s name was mrs coiler and i had the honour of taking her\\ndown to dinner on the day of my installation she gave me to understand\\non the stairs that it was a blow to dear mrs pocket that dear mr\\npocket should be under the necessity of receiving gentlemen to read\\nwith him that did not extend to me she told me in a gush of love and\\nconfidence at that time i had known her something less than five\\nminutes if they were all like me it would be quite another thing\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbut dear mrs pocketâ\\x80\\x9d said mrs coiler â\\x80\\x9cafter her early\\ndisappointment not that dear mr pocket was to blame in that\\nrequires so much luxury and eleganceâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyes maâ\\x80\\x99amâ\\x80\\x9d i said to stop her for i was afraid she was going to\\ncry\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cand she is of so aristocratic a dispositionâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyes maâ\\x80\\x99amâ\\x80\\x9d i said again with the same object as before\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x94that it is hardâ\\x80\\x9d said mrs coiler â\\x80\\x9cto have dear mr pocketâ\\x80\\x99s time\\nand attention diverted from dear mrs pocketâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni could not help thinking that it might be harder if the butcherâ\\x80\\x99s time\\nand attention were diverted from dear mrs pocket but i said nothing\\nand indeed had enough to do in keeping a bashful watch upon my company\\nmanners\\n\\nit came to my knowledge through what passed between mrs pocket and\\ndrummle while i was attentive to my knife and fork spoon glasses and\\nother instruments of selfdestruction that drummle whose christian\\nname was bentley was actually the next heir but one to a baronetcy it\\nfurther appeared that the book i had seen mrs pocket reading in the\\ngarden was all about titles and that she knew the exact date at which\\nher grandpapa would have come into the book if he ever had come at\\nall drummle didnâ\\x80\\x99t say much but in his limited way he struck me as a\\nsulky kind of fellow he spoke as one of the elect and recognised mrs\\npocket as a woman and a sister no one but themselves and mrs coiler\\nthe toady neighbour showed any interest in this part of the\\nconversation and it appeared to me that it was painful to herbert but\\nit promised to last a long time when the page came in with the\\nannouncement of a domestic affliction it was in effect that the cook\\nhad mislaid the beef to my unutterable amazement i now for the first\\ntime saw mr pocket relieve his mind by going through a performance\\nthat struck me as very extraordinary but which made no impression on\\nanybody else and with which i soon became as familiar as the rest he\\nlaid down the carvingknife and forkâ\\x80\\x94being engaged in carving at the\\nmomentâ\\x80\\x94put his two hands into his disturbed hair and appeared to make\\nan extraordinary effort to lift himself up by it when he had done\\nthis and had not lifted himself up at all he quietly went on with\\nwhat he was about\\n\\nmrs coiler then changed the subject and began to flatter me i liked\\nit for a few moments but she flattered me so very grossly that the\\npleasure was soon over she had a serpentine way of coming close at me\\nwhen she pretended to be vitally interested in the friends and\\nlocalities i had left which was altogether snaky and forktongued and\\nwhen she made an occasional bounce upon startop who said very little\\nto her or upon drummle who said less i rather envied them for\\nbeing on the opposite side of the table\\n\\nafter dinner the children were introduced and mrs coiler made\\nadmiring comments on their eyes noses and legsâ\\x80\\x94a sagacious way of\\nimproving their minds there were four little girls and two little\\nboys besides the baby who might have been either and the babyâ\\x80\\x99s next\\nsuccessor who was as yet neither they were brought in by flopson and\\nmillers much as though those two noncommissioned officers had been\\nrecruiting somewhere for children and had enlisted these while mrs\\npocket looked at the young nobles that ought to have been as if she\\nrather thought she had had the pleasure of inspecting them before but\\ndidnâ\\x80\\x99t quite know what to make of them\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9chere give me your fork mum and take the babyâ\\x80\\x9d said flopson â\\x80\\x9cdonâ\\x80\\x99t\\ntake it that way or youâ\\x80\\x99ll get its head under the tableâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthus advised mrs pocket took it the other way and got its head upon\\nthe table which was announced to all present by a prodigious\\nconcussion\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cdear dear give it me back mumâ\\x80\\x9d said flopson â\\x80\\x9cand miss jane come\\nand dance to baby doâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\none of the little girls a mere mite who seemed to have prematurely\\ntaken upon herself some charge of the others stepped out of her place\\nby me and danced to and from the baby until it left off crying and\\nlaughed then all the children laughed and mr pocket who in the\\nmeantime had twice endeavoured to lift himself up by the hair laughed\\nand we all laughed and were glad\\n\\nflopson by dint of doubling the baby at the joints like a dutch doll\\nthen got it safely into mrs pocketâ\\x80\\x99s lap and gave it the nutcrackers\\nto play with at the same time recommending mrs pocket to take notice\\nthat the handles of that instrument were not likely to agree with its\\neyes and sharply charging miss jane to look after the same then the\\ntwo nurses left the room and had a lively scuffle on the staircase\\nwith a dissipated page who had waited at dinner and who had clearly\\nlost half his buttons at the gamingtable\\n\\ni was made very uneasy in my mind by mrs pocketâ\\x80\\x99s falling into a\\ndiscussion with drummle respecting two baronetcies while she ate a\\nsliced orange steeped in sugar and wine and forgetting all about the\\nbaby on her lap who did most appalling things with the nutcrackers\\nat length little jane perceiving its young brains to be imperilled\\nsoftly left her place and with many small artifices coaxed the\\ndangerous weapon away mrs pocket finishing her orange at about the\\nsame time and not approving of this said to janeâ\\x80\\x94\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou naughty child how dare you go and sit down this instantâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmamma dearâ\\x80\\x9d lisped the little girl â\\x80\\x9cbaby ood have put hith eyeth\\noutâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9chow dare you tell me soâ\\x80\\x9d retorted mrs pocket â\\x80\\x9cgo and sit down in\\nyour chair this momentâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nmrs pocketâ\\x80\\x99s dignity was so crushing that i felt quite abashed as if\\ni myself had done something to rouse it\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbelindaâ\\x80\\x9d remonstrated mr pocket from the other end of the table\\nâ\\x80\\x9chow can you be so unreasonable jane only interfered for the\\nprotection of babyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci will not allow anybody to interfereâ\\x80\\x9d said mrs pocket â\\x80\\x9ci am\\nsurprised matthew that you should expose me to the affront of\\ninterferenceâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cgood godâ\\x80\\x9d cried mr pocket in an outbreak of desolate desperation\\nâ\\x80\\x9care infants to be nutcrackered into their tombs and is nobody to\\nsave themâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci will not be interfered with by janeâ\\x80\\x9d said mrs pocket with a\\nmajestic glance at that innocent little offender â\\x80\\x9ci hope i know my\\npoor grandpapaâ\\x80\\x99s position jane indeedâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nmr pocket got his hands in his hair again and this time really did\\nlift himself some inches out of his chair â\\x80\\x9chear thisâ\\x80\\x9d he helplessly\\nexclaimed to the elements â\\x80\\x9cbabies are to be nutcrackered dead for\\npeopleâ\\x80\\x99s poor grandpapaâ\\x80\\x99s positionsâ\\x80\\x9d then he let himself down again\\nand became silent\\n\\nwe all looked awkwardly at the tablecloth while this was going on a\\npause succeeded during which the honest and irrepressible baby made a\\nseries of leaps and crows at little jane who appeared to me to be the\\nonly member of the family irrespective of servants with whom it had\\nany decided acquaintance\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmr drummleâ\\x80\\x9d said mrs pocket â\\x80\\x9cwill you ring for flopson jane you\\nundutiful little thing go and lie down now baby darling come with\\nmaâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthe baby was the soul of honour and protested with all its might it\\ndoubled itself up the wrong way over mrs pocketâ\\x80\\x99s arm exhibited a\\npair of knitted shoes and dimpled ankles to the company in lieu of its\\nsoft face and was carried out in the highest state of mutiny and it\\ngained its point after all for i saw it through the window within a\\nfew minutes being nursed by little jane\\n\\nit happened that the other five children were left behind at the\\ndinnertable through flopsonâ\\x80\\x99s having some private engagement and\\ntheir not being anybody elseâ\\x80\\x99s business i thus became aware of the\\nmutual relations between them and mr pocket which were exemplified in\\nthe following manner mr pocket with the normal perplexity of his\\nface heightened and his hair rumpled looked at them for some minutes\\nas if he couldnâ\\x80\\x99t make out how they came to be boarding and lodging in\\nthat establishment and why they hadnâ\\x80\\x99t been billeted by nature on\\nsomebody else then in a distant missionary way he asked them certain\\nquestionsâ\\x80\\x94as why little joe had that hole in his frill who said pa\\nflopson was going to mend it when she had timeâ\\x80\\x94and how little fanny\\ncame by that whitlow who said pa millers was going to poultice it\\nwhen she didnâ\\x80\\x99t forget then he melted into parental tenderness and\\ngave them a shilling apiece and told them to go and play and then as\\nthey went out with one very strong effort to lift himself up by the\\nhair he dismissed the hopeless subject\\n\\nin the evening there was rowing on the river as drummle and startop\\nhad each a boat i resolved to set up mine and to cut them both out i\\nwas pretty good at most exercises in which country boys are adepts but\\nas i was conscious of wanting elegance of style for the thamesâ\\x80\\x94not to\\nsay for other watersâ\\x80\\x94i at once engaged to place myself under the\\ntuition of the winner of a prizewherry who plied at our stairs and to\\nwhom i was introduced by my new allies this practical authority\\nconfused me very much by saying i had the arm of a blacksmith if he\\ncould have known how nearly the compliment lost him his pupil i doubt\\nif he would have paid it\\n\\nthere was a suppertray after we got home at night and i think we\\nshould all have enjoyed ourselves but for a rather disagreeable\\ndomestic occurrence mr pocket was in good spirits when a housemaid\\ncame in and said â\\x80\\x9cif you please sir i should wish to speak to youâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cspeak to your masterâ\\x80\\x9d said mrs pocket whose dignity was roused\\nagain â\\x80\\x9chow can you think of such a thing go and speak to flopson or\\nspeak to meâ\\x80\\x94at some other timeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbegging your pardon maâ\\x80\\x99amâ\\x80\\x9d returned the housemaid â\\x80\\x9ci should wish to\\nspeak at once and to speak to masterâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nhereupon mr pocket went out of the room and we made the best of\\nourselves until he came back\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthis is a pretty thing belindaâ\\x80\\x9d said mr pocket returning with a\\ncountenance expressive of grief and despair â\\x80\\x9chereâ\\x80\\x99s the cook lying\\ninsensibly drunk on the kitchen floor with a large bundle of fresh\\nbutter made up in the cupboard ready to sell for greaseâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nmrs pocket instantly showed much amiable emotion and said â\\x80\\x9cthis is\\nthat odious sophiaâ\\x80\\x99s doingâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhat do you mean belindaâ\\x80\\x9d demanded mr pocket\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9csophia has told youâ\\x80\\x9d said mrs pocket â\\x80\\x9cdid i not see her with my own\\neyes and hear her with my own ears come into the room just now and ask\\nto speak to youâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbut has she not taken me downstairs belindaâ\\x80\\x9d returned mr pocket\\nâ\\x80\\x9cand shown me the woman and the bundle tooâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cand do you defend her matthewâ\\x80\\x9d said mrs pocket â\\x80\\x9cfor making\\nmischiefâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nmr pocket uttered a dismal groan\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cam i grandpapaâ\\x80\\x99s granddaughter to be nothing in the houseâ\\x80\\x9d said\\nmrs pocket â\\x80\\x9cbesides the cook has always been a very nice respectful\\nwoman and said in the most natural manner when she came to look after\\nthe situation that she felt i was born to be a duchessâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthere was a sofa where mr pocket stood and he dropped upon it in the\\nattitude of the dying gladiator still in that attitude he said with a\\nhollow voice â\\x80\\x9cgood night mr pipâ\\x80\\x9d when i deemed it advisable to go\\nto bed and leave him\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter xxiv\\n\\n\\nafter two or three days when i had established myself in my room and\\nhad gone backwards and forwards to london several times and had\\nordered all i wanted of my tradesmen mr pocket and i had a long talk\\ntogether he knew more of my intended career than i knew myself for he\\nreferred to his having been told by mr jaggers that i was not designed\\nfor any profession and that i should be well enough educated for my\\ndestiny if i could â\\x80\\x9chold my ownâ\\x80\\x9d with the average of young men in\\nprosperous circumstances i acquiesced of course knowing nothing to\\nthe contrary\\n\\nhe advised my attending certain places in london for the acquisition\\nof such mere rudiments as i wanted and my investing him with the\\nfunctions of explainer and director of all my studies he hoped that\\nwith intelligent assistance i should meet with little to discourage me\\nand should soon be able to dispense with any aid but his through his\\nway of saying this and much more to similar purpose he placed himself\\non confidential terms with me in an admirable manner and i may state\\nat once that he was always so zealous and honourable in fulfilling his\\ncompact with me that he made me zealous and honourable in fulfilling\\nmine with him if he had shown indifference as a master i have no\\ndoubt i should have returned the compliment as a pupil he gave me no\\nsuch excuse and each of us did the other justice nor did i ever\\nregard him as having anything ludicrous about himâ\\x80\\x94or anything but what\\nwas serious honest and goodâ\\x80\\x94in his tutor communication with me\\n\\nwhen these points were settled and so far carried out as that i had\\nbegun to work in earnest it occurred to me that if i could retain my\\nbedroom in barnardâ\\x80\\x99s inn my life would be agreeably varied while my\\nmanners would be none the worse for herbertâ\\x80\\x99s society mr pocket did\\nnot object to this arrangement but urged that before any step could\\npossibly be taken in it it must be submitted to my guardian i felt\\nthat this delicacy arose out of the consideration that the plan would\\nsave herbert some expense so i went off to little britain and imparted\\nmy wish to mr jaggers\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cif i could buy the furniture now hired for meâ\\x80\\x9d said i â\\x80\\x9cand one or\\ntwo other little things i should be quite at home thereâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cgo itâ\\x80\\x9d said mr jaggers with a short laugh â\\x80\\x9ci told you youâ\\x80\\x99d get\\non well how much do you wantâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni said i didnâ\\x80\\x99t know how much\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ccomeâ\\x80\\x9d retorted mr jaggers â\\x80\\x9chow much fifty poundsâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9co not nearly so muchâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cfive poundsâ\\x80\\x9d said mr jaggers\\n\\nthis was such a great fall that i said in discomfiture â\\x80\\x9co more than\\nthatâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmore than that ehâ\\x80\\x9d retorted mr jaggers lying in wait for me with\\nhis hands in his pockets his head on one side and his eyes on the\\nwall behind me â\\x80\\x9chow much moreâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cit is so difficult to fix a sumâ\\x80\\x9d said i hesitating\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ccomeâ\\x80\\x9d said mr jaggers â\\x80\\x9cletâ\\x80\\x99s get at it twice five will that do\\nthree times five will that do four times five will that doâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni said i thought that would do handsomely\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cfour times five will do handsomely will itâ\\x80\\x9d said mr jaggers\\nknitting his brows â\\x80\\x9cnow what do you make of four times fiveâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhat do i make of itâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cahâ\\x80\\x9d said mr jaggers â\\x80\\x9chow muchâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci suppose you make it twenty poundsâ\\x80\\x9d said i smiling\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnever mind what i make it my friendâ\\x80\\x9d observed mr jaggers with a\\nknowing and contradictory toss of his head â\\x80\\x9ci want to know what you\\nmake itâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ctwenty pounds of courseâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwemmickâ\\x80\\x9d said mr jaggers opening his office door â\\x80\\x9ctake mr pipâ\\x80\\x99s\\nwritten order and pay him twenty poundsâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthis strongly marked way of doing business made a strongly marked\\nimpression on me and that not of an agreeable kind mr jaggers never\\nlaughed but he wore great bright creaking boots and in poising\\nhimself on these boots with his large head bent down and his eyebrows\\njoined together awaiting an answer he sometimes caused the boots to\\ncreak as if they laughed in a dry and suspicious way as he happened\\nto go out now and as wemmick was brisk and talkative i said to\\nwemmick that i hardly knew what to make of mr jaggersâ\\x80\\x99s manner\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ctell him that and heâ\\x80\\x99ll take it as a complimentâ\\x80\\x9d answered wemmick\\nâ\\x80\\x9che donâ\\x80\\x99t mean that you should know what to make of itâ\\x80\\x94ohâ\\x80\\x9d for i\\nlooked surprised â\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s not personal itâ\\x80\\x99s professional only\\nprofessionalâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nwemmick was at his desk lunchingâ\\x80\\x94and crunchingâ\\x80\\x94on a dry hard biscuit\\npieces of which he threw from time to time into his slit of a mouth as\\nif he were posting them\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9calways seems to meâ\\x80\\x9d said wemmick â\\x80\\x9cas if he had set a mantrap and\\nwas watching it suddenlyâ\\x80\\x94clickâ\\x80\\x94youâ\\x80\\x99re caughtâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nwithout remarking that mantraps were not among the amenities of life\\ni said i supposed he was very skilful\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cdeepâ\\x80\\x9d said wemmick â\\x80\\x9cas australiaâ\\x80\\x9d pointing with his pen at the\\noffice floor to express that australia was understood for the\\npurposes of the figure to be symmetrically on the opposite spot of the\\nglobe â\\x80\\x9cif there was anything deeperâ\\x80\\x9d added wemmick bringing his pen\\nto paper â\\x80\\x9cheâ\\x80\\x99d be itâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthen i said i supposed he had a fine business and wemmick said\\nâ\\x80\\x9ccapitalâ\\x80\\x9d then i asked if there were many clerks to which he\\nrepliedâ\\x80\\x94\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwe donâ\\x80\\x99t run much into clerks because thereâ\\x80\\x99s only one jaggers and\\npeople wonâ\\x80\\x99t have him at second hand there are only four of us would\\nyou like to see â\\x80\\x99em you are one of us as i may sayâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni accepted the offer when mr wemmick had put all the biscuit into the\\npost and had paid me my money from a cashbox in a safe the key of\\nwhich safe he kept somewhere down his back and produced from his\\ncoatcollar like an ironpigtail we went upstairs the house was dark\\nand shabby and the greasy shoulders that had left their mark in mr\\njaggersâ\\x80\\x99s room seemed to have been shuffling up and down the staircase\\nfor years in the front first floor a clerk who looked something\\nbetween a publican and a ratcatcherâ\\x80\\x94a large pale puffed swollen\\nmanâ\\x80\\x94was attentively engaged with three or four people of shabby\\nappearance whom he treated as unceremoniously as everybody seemed to\\nbe treated who contributed to mr jaggersâ\\x80\\x99s coffers â\\x80\\x9cgetting evidence\\ntogetherâ\\x80\\x9d said mr wemmick as we came out â\\x80\\x9cfor the baileyâ\\x80\\x9d in the\\nroom over that a little flabby terrier of a clerk with dangling hair\\nhis cropping seemed to have been forgotten when he was a puppy was\\nsimilarly engaged with a man with weak eyes whom mr wemmick presented\\nto me as a smelter who kept his pot always boiling and who would melt\\nme anything i pleasedâ\\x80\\x94and who was in an excessive whiteperspiration\\nas if he had been trying his art on himself in a back room a\\nhighshouldered man with a faceache tied up in dirty flannel who was\\ndressed in old black clothes that bore the appearance of having been\\nwaxed was stooping over his work of making fair copies of the notes of\\nthe other two gentlemen for mr jaggersâ\\x80\\x99s own use\\n\\nthis was all the establishment when we went downstairs again wemmick\\nled me into my guardianâ\\x80\\x99s room and said â\\x80\\x9cthis youâ\\x80\\x99ve seen alreadyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cprayâ\\x80\\x9d said i as the two odious casts with the twitchy leer upon them\\ncaught my sight again â\\x80\\x9cwhose likenesses are thoseâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ctheseâ\\x80\\x9d said wemmick getting upon a chair and blowing the dust off\\nthe horrible heads before bringing them down â\\x80\\x9cthese are two celebrated\\nones famous clients of ours that got us a world of credit this chap\\nwhy you must have come down in the night and been peeping into the\\ninkstand to get this blot upon your eyebrow you old rascal murdered\\nhis master and considering that he wasnâ\\x80\\x99t brought up to evidence\\ndidnâ\\x80\\x99t plan it badlyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cis it like himâ\\x80\\x9d i asked recoiling from the brute as wemmick spat\\nupon his eyebrow and gave it a rub with his sleeve\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9clike him itâ\\x80\\x99s himself you know the cast was made in newgate\\ndirectly after he was taken down you had a particular fancy for me\\nhadnâ\\x80\\x99t you old artfulâ\\x80\\x9d said wemmick he then explained this\\naffectionate apostrophe by touching his brooch representing the lady\\nand the weeping willow at the tomb with the urn upon it and saying\\nâ\\x80\\x9chad it made for me expressâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cis the lady anybodyâ\\x80\\x9d said i\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnoâ\\x80\\x9d returned wemmick â\\x80\\x9conly his game you liked your bit of game\\ndidnâ\\x80\\x99t you no deuce a bit of a lady in the case mr pip except\\noneâ\\x80\\x94and she wasnâ\\x80\\x99t of this slender ladylike sort and you wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t\\nhave caught her looking after this urn unless there was something to\\ndrink in itâ\\x80\\x9d wemmickâ\\x80\\x99s attention being thus directed to his brooch he\\nput down the cast and polished the brooch with his\\npockethandkerchief\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cdid that other creature come to the same endâ\\x80\\x9d i asked â\\x80\\x9che has the\\nsame lookâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyouâ\\x80\\x99re rightâ\\x80\\x9d said wemmick â\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s the genuine look much as if one\\nnostril was caught up with a horsehair and a little fishhook yes he\\ncame to the same end quite the natural end here i assure you he\\nforged wills this blade did if he didnâ\\x80\\x99t also put the supposed\\ntestators to sleep too you were a gentlemanly cove thoughâ\\x80\\x9d mr\\nwemmick was again apostrophising â\\x80\\x9cand you said you could write greek\\nyah bounceable what a liar you were i never met such a liar as youâ\\x80\\x9d\\nbefore putting his late friend on his shelf again wemmick touched the\\nlargest of his mourning rings and said â\\x80\\x9csent out to buy it for me\\nonly the day beforeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nwhile he was putting up the other cast and coming down from the chair\\nthe thought crossed my mind that all his personal jewelry was derived\\nfrom like sources as he had shown no diffidence on the subject i\\nventured on the liberty of asking him the question when he stood\\nbefore me dusting his hands\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9co yesâ\\x80\\x9d he returned â\\x80\\x9cthese are all gifts of that kind one brings\\nanother you see thatâ\\x80\\x99s the way of it i always take â\\x80\\x99em theyâ\\x80\\x99re\\ncuriosities and theyâ\\x80\\x99re property they may not be worth much but\\nafter all theyâ\\x80\\x99re property and portable it donâ\\x80\\x99t signify to you with\\nyour brilliant lookout but as to myself my guidingstar always is\\nâ\\x80\\x98get hold of portable propertyâ\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nwhen i had rendered homage to this light he went on to say in a\\nfriendly mannerâ\\x80\\x94\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cif at any odd time when you have nothing better to do you wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t\\nmind coming over to see me at walworth i could offer you a bed and i\\nshould consider it an honour i have not much to show you but such two\\nor three curiosities as i have got you might like to look over and i\\nam fond of a bit of garden and a summerhouseâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni said i should be delighted to accept his hospitality\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthankeeâ\\x80\\x9d said he â\\x80\\x9cthen weâ\\x80\\x99ll consider that itâ\\x80\\x99s to come off when\\nconvenient to you have you dined with mr jaggers yetâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnot yetâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwellâ\\x80\\x9d said wemmick â\\x80\\x9cheâ\\x80\\x99ll give you wine and good wine iâ\\x80\\x99ll give\\nyou punch and not bad punch and now iâ\\x80\\x99ll tell you something when you\\ngo to dine with mr jaggers look at his housekeeperâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cshall i see something very uncommonâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwellâ\\x80\\x9d said wemmick â\\x80\\x9cyouâ\\x80\\x99ll see a wild beast tamed not so very\\nuncommon youâ\\x80\\x99ll tell me i reply that depends on the original\\nwildness of the beast and the amount of taming it wonâ\\x80\\x99t lower your\\nopinion of mr jaggersâ\\x80\\x99s powers keep your eye on itâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni told him i would do so with all the interest and curiosity that his\\npreparation awakened as i was taking my departure he asked me if i\\nwould like to devote five minutes to seeing mr jaggers â\\x80\\x9cat itâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nfor several reasons and not least because i didnâ\\x80\\x99t clearly know what\\nmr jaggers would be found to be â\\x80\\x9catâ\\x80\\x9d i replied in the affirmative we\\ndived into the city and came up in a crowded policecourt where a\\nbloodrelation in the murderous sense of the deceased with the\\nfanciful taste in brooches was standing at the bar uncomfortably\\nchewing something while my guardian had a woman under examination or\\ncrossexaminationâ\\x80\\x94i donâ\\x80\\x99t know whichâ\\x80\\x94and was striking her and the\\nbench and everybody present with awe if anybody of whatsoever\\ndegree said a word that he didnâ\\x80\\x99t approve of he instantly required to\\nhave it â\\x80\\x9ctaken downâ\\x80\\x9d if anybody wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t make an admission he said\\nâ\\x80\\x9ciâ\\x80\\x99ll have it out of youâ\\x80\\x9d and if anybody made an admission he said\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnow i have got youâ\\x80\\x9d the magistrates shivered under a single bite of\\nhis finger thieves and thieftakers hung in dread rapture on his\\nwords and shrank when a hair of his eyebrows turned in their\\ndirection which side he was on i couldnâ\\x80\\x99t make out for he seemed to\\nme to be grinding the whole place in a mill i only know that when i\\nstole out on tiptoe he was not on the side of the bench for he was\\nmaking the legs of the old gentleman who presided quite convulsive\\nunder the table by his denunciations of his conduct as the\\nrepresentative of british law and justice in that chair that day\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter xxv\\n\\n\\nbentley drummle who was so sulky a fellow that he even took up a book\\nas if its writer had done him an injury did not take up an\\nacquaintance in a more agreeable spirit heavy in figure movement and\\ncomprehensionâ\\x80\\x94in the sluggish complexion of his face and in the\\nlarge awkward tongue that seemed to loll about in his mouth as he\\nhimself lolled about in a roomâ\\x80\\x94he was idle proud niggardly\\nreserved and suspicious he came of rich people down in somersetshire\\nwho had nursed this combination of qualities until they made the\\ndiscovery that it was just of age and a blockhead thus bentley\\ndrummle had come to mr pocket when he was a head taller than that\\ngentleman and half a dozen heads thicker than most gentlemen\\n\\nstartop had been spoilt by a weak mother and kept at home when he ought\\nto have been at school but he was devotedly attached to her and\\nadmired her beyond measure he had a womanâ\\x80\\x99s delicacy of feature and\\nwasâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cas you may see though you never saw herâ\\x80\\x9d said herbert to\\nmeâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cexactly like his motherâ\\x80\\x9d it was but natural that i should take to\\nhim much more kindly than to drummle and that even in the earliest\\nevenings of our boating he and i should pull homeward abreast of one\\nanother conversing from boat to boat while bentley drummle came up in\\nour wake alone under the overhanging banks and among the rushes he\\nwould always creep inshore like some uncomfortable amphibious\\ncreature even when the tide would have sent him fast upon his way and\\ni always think of him as coming after us in the dark or by the\\nbackwater when our own two boats were breaking the sunset or the\\nmoonlight in midstream\\n\\nherbert was my intimate companion and friend i presented him with a\\nhalfshare in my boat which was the occasion of his often coming down\\nto hammersmith and my possession of a halfshare in his chambers often\\ntook me up to london we used to walk between the two places at all\\nhours i have an affection for the road yet though it is not so\\npleasant a road as it was then formed in the impressibility of\\nuntried youth and hope\\n\\nwhen i had been in mr pocketâ\\x80\\x99s family a month or two mr and mrs\\ncamilla turned up camilla was mr pocketâ\\x80\\x99s sister georgiana whom i\\nhad seen at miss havishamâ\\x80\\x99s on the same occasion also turned up she\\nwas a cousinâ\\x80\\x94an indigestive single woman who called her rigidity\\nreligion and her liver love these people hated me with the hatred of\\ncupidity and disappointment as a matter of course they fawned upon me\\nin my prosperity with the basest meanness towards mr pocket as a\\ngrownup infant with no notion of his own interests they showed the\\ncomplacent forbearance i had heard them express mrs pocket they held\\nin contempt but they allowed the poor soul to have been heavily\\ndisappointed in life because that shed a feeble reflected light upon\\nthemselves\\n\\nthese were the surroundings among which i settled down and applied\\nmyself to my education i soon contracted expensive habits and began\\nto spend an amount of money that within a few short months i should\\nhave thought almost fabulous but through good and evil i stuck to my\\nbooks there was no other merit in this than my having sense enough to\\nfeel my deficiencies between mr pocket and herbert i got on fast\\nand with one or the other always at my elbow to give me the start i\\nwanted and clear obstructions out of my road i must have been as\\ngreat a dolt as drummle if i had done less\\n\\ni had not seen mr wemmick for some weeks when i thought i would write\\nhim a note and propose to go home with him on a certain evening he\\nreplied that it would give him much pleasure and that he would expect\\nme at the office at six oâ\\x80\\x99clock thither i went and there i found him\\nputting the key of his safe down his back as the clock struck\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cdid you think of walking down to walworthâ\\x80\\x9d said he\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ccertainlyâ\\x80\\x9d said i â\\x80\\x9cif you approveâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cvery muchâ\\x80\\x9d was wemmickâ\\x80\\x99s reply â\\x80\\x9cfor i have had my legs under the\\ndesk all day and shall be glad to stretch them now iâ\\x80\\x99ll tell you\\nwhat i have got for supper mr pip i have got a stewed steakâ\\x80\\x94which\\nis of home preparationâ\\x80\\x94and a cold roast fowlâ\\x80\\x94which is from the\\ncookâ\\x80\\x99sshop i think itâ\\x80\\x99s tender because the master of the shop was a\\njuryman in some cases of ours the other day and we let him down easy\\ni reminded him of it when i bought the fowl and i said â\\x80\\x9cpick us out a\\ngood one old briton because if we had chosen to keep you in the box\\nanother day or two we could easily have done itâ\\x80\\x9d he said to

required\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cso you havenâ\\x80\\x99t dined with mr jaggers yetâ\\x80\\x9d he pursued as we walked\\nalong\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnot yetâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9che told me so this afternoon

youâ\\x80\\x99ll have excellence and thereâ\\x80\\x99s another rum\\nthing in his houseâ\\x80\\x9d proceeded wemmick after a momentâ\\x80\\x99s pause as if\\nthe remark followed on the housekeeper understood â\\x80\\x9che never lets a\\ndoor or window be fastened at nightâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cis he never robbedâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthatâ\\x80\\x99s itâ\\x80\\x9d returned wemmick

wemmick â\\x80\\x9ci believe you they dread him not but what\\nheâ\\x80\\x99s artful even in his defiance of them no silver sir britannia\\nmetal every spoonâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cso they wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t have muchâ\\x80\\x9d i observed â\\x80\\x9ceven if theyâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cah but he would have muchâ\\x80\\x9d said wemmick cutting me short â\\x80\\x9cand\\nthey know it heâ\\x80\\x99d have their lives and the lives of scores of â\\x80\\x99em\\nheâ\\x80\\x99d have all he could get and itâ\\x80\\x99s impossible to say what he couldnâ\\x80\\x99t\\nget if he gave his mind to itâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni was falling into meditation on my guardianâ\\x80\\x99s greatness when wemmick\\nremarkedâ\\x80\\x94\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cas to the absence of plate thatâ\\x80\\x99s only his natural depth you know a\\nriverâ\\x80\\x99s its natural depth and heâ\\x80\\x99s his natural depth look at his\\nwatchchain thatâ\\x80\\x99s real enoughâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s very massiveâ\\x80\\x9d said i\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmassiveâ\\x80\\x9d repeated wemmick â\\x80\\x9ci think so and his watch is a gold\\nrepeater and worth a hundred pound if itâ\\x80\\x99s worth a penny mr pip\\nthere are about seven hundred thieves in this town who know all about\\nthat watch thereâ\\x80\\x99s not a man a woman or a child among them who\\nwouldnâ\\x80\\x99t identify the smallest link in that chain and drop it as if it\\nwas red hot if inveigled into touching itâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nat first with such discourse and afterwards with conversation of a\\nmore general nature did mr wemmick and i beguile the time and the\\nroad until he gave me to understand that we had arrived in the\\ndistrict of walworth\\n\\nit appeared to be a collection of back lanes ditches and little\\ngardens and to present the aspect of a rather dull retirement\\nwemmickâ\\x80\\x99s house was a little wooden cottage in the midst of plots of\\ngarden and the top of it was cut out and painted like a battery\\nmounted with guns\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmy own doingâ\\x80\\x9d said wemmick â\\x80\\x9clooks pretty donâ\\x80\\x99t itâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni highly commended it i think it was the smallest house i ever saw\\nwith the queerest gothic windows by far the greater part of them\\nsham and a gothic door almost too small to get in at\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthatâ\\x80\\x99s a real flagstaff you seeâ\\x80\\x9d said wemmick â\\x80\\x9cand on sundays i run\\nup a real flag then look here after i have crossed this bridge i\\nhoist it upâ\\x80\\x94soâ\\x80\\x94and cut off the communicationâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthe bridge was a plank and it crossed a chasm about four feet wide and\\ntwo deep but it was very pleasant to see the pride with which he\\nhoisted it up and made it fast smiling as he did so with a relish and\\nnot merely mechanically\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cat nine oâ\\x80\\x99clock every night greenwich timeâ\\x80\\x9d said wemmick â\\x80\\x9cthe gun\\nfires there he is you see and when you hear him go i think youâ\\x80\\x99ll\\nsay heâ\\x80\\x99s a stingerâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthe piece of ordnance referred to was mounted in a separate fortress\\nconstructed of latticework it was protected from the weather by an\\ningenious little tarpaulin contrivance in the nature of an umbrella\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthen at the backâ\\x80\\x9d said wemmick â\\x80\\x9cout of sight so as not to impede\\nthe idea of fortificationsâ\\x80\\x94for itâ\\x80\\x99s a principle with me if you have\\nan idea carry it out and keep it upâ\\x80\\x94i donâ\\x80\\x99t know whether thatâ\\x80\\x99s your\\nopinionâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni said decidedly\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x94at the back thereâ\\x80\\x99s a pig and there are fowls and rabbits then i\\nknock together my own little frame you see and grow cucumbers and\\nyouâ\\x80\\x99ll judge at supper what sort of a salad i can raise so sirâ\\x80\\x9d said\\nwemmick smiling again but seriously too as he shook his head â\\x80\\x9cif\\nyou can suppose the little place besieged it would hold out a devil of\\na time in point of provisionsâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthen he conducted me to a bower about a dozen yards off but which was\\napproached by such ingenious twists of path that it took quite a long\\ntime to get at and in this retreat our glasses were already set forth\\nour punch was cooling in an ornamental lake on whose margin the bower\\nwas raised this piece of water with an island in the middle which\\nmight have been the salad for supper was of a circular form and he\\nhad constructed a fountain in it which when you set a little mill\\ngoing and took a cork out of a pipe played to that powerful extent\\nthat it made the back of your hand quite wet\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci am my own engineer and my own carpenter and my own plumber and my\\nown gardener and my own jack of all tradesâ\\x80\\x9d said wemmick in\\nacknowledging my compliments â\\x80\\x9cwell itâ\\x80\\x99s a good thing you know it\\nbrushes the newgate cobwebs away and pleases the aged you wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t\\nmind being at once introduced to the aged would you it wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t put\\nyou outâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni expressed the readiness i felt and we went into the castle there we\\nfound sitting by a fire a very old man in a flannel coat clean\\ncheerful comfortable and well cared for but intensely deaf\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwell aged parentâ\\x80\\x9d said wemmick shaking hands with him in a cordial\\nand jocose way â\\x80\\x9chow am youâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9call right john all rightâ\\x80\\x9d replied the old man\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9chereâ\\x80\\x99s mr pip aged parentâ\\x80\\x9d said wemmick â\\x80\\x9cand i wish you could hear\\nhis name nod away at him mr pip thatâ\\x80\\x99s what he likes nod away at\\nhim if you please like winkingâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthis is a fine place of my sonâ\\x80\\x99s sirâ\\x80\\x9d cried the old man while i\\nnodded as hard as i possibly could â\\x80\\x9cthis is a pretty pleasureground\\nsir this spot and these beautiful works upon it ought to be kept\\ntogether by the nation after my sonâ\\x80\\x99s time for the peopleâ\\x80\\x99s\\nenjoymentâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyouâ\\x80\\x99re as proud of it as punch ainâ\\x80\\x99t you agedâ\\x80\\x9d said wemmick\\ncontemplating the old man with his hard face really softened\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthereâ\\x80\\x99s a nod for youâ\\x80\\x9d giving him a tremendous one â\\x80\\x9cthereâ\\x80\\x99s\\nanother for youâ\\x80\\x9d giving him a still more tremendous one â\\x80\\x9cyou like\\nthat donâ\\x80\\x99t you if youâ\\x80\\x99re not tired mr pipâ\\x80\\x94though i know itâ\\x80\\x99s tiring\\nto strangersâ\\x80\\x94will you tip him one more you canâ\\x80\\x99t think how it pleases\\nhimâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni tipped him several more and he was in great spirits we left him\\nbestirring himself to feed the fowls and we sat down to our punch in\\nthe arbour where wemmick told me as he smoked a pipe that it had\\ntaken him a good many years to bring the property up to its present\\npitch of perfection\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cis it your own mr wemmickâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9co yesâ\\x80\\x9d said wemmick â\\x80\\x9ci have got hold of it a bit at a time itâ\\x80\\x99s a\\nfreehold by georgeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cis it indeed i hope mr jaggers admires itâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnever seen itâ\\x80\\x9d said wemmick â\\x80\\x9cnever heard of it never seen the aged\\nnever heard of him no the office is one thing and private life is\\nanother when i go into the office i leave the castle behind me and\\nwhen i come into the castle i leave the office behind me if itâ\\x80\\x99s not\\nin any way disagreeable to you youâ\\x80\\x99ll oblige me by doing the same i\\ndonâ\\x80\\x99t wish it professionally spoken aboutâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nof course i felt my good faith involved in the observance of his\\nrequest the punch being very nice we sat there drinking it and\\ntalking until it was almost nine oâ\\x80\\x99clock â\\x80\\x9cgetting near gunfireâ\\x80\\x9d\\nsaid wemmick then as he laid down his pipe â\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s the agedâ\\x80\\x99s treatâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nproceeding into the castle again we found the aged heating the poker\\nwith expectant eyes as a preliminary to the performance of this great\\nnightly ceremony wemmick stood with his watch in his hand until the\\nmoment was come for him to take the redhot poker from the aged and\\nrepair to the battery he took it and went out and presently the\\nstinger went off with a bang that shook the crazy little box of a\\ncottage as if it must fall to pieces and made every glass and teacup\\nin it ring upon this the agedâ\\x80\\x94who i believe would have been blown out\\nof his armchair but for holding on by the elbowsâ\\x80\\x94cried out exultingly\\nâ\\x80\\x9cheâ\\x80\\x99s fired i heerd himâ\\x80\\x9d and i nodded at the old gentleman until it\\nis no figure of speech to declare that i absolutely could not see him\\n\\nthe interval between that time and supper wemmick devoted to showing me\\nhis collection of curiosities they were mostly of a felonious\\ncharacter comprising the pen with which a celebrated forgery had been\\ncommitted a distinguished razor or two some locks of hair and\\nseveral manuscript confessions written under condemnationâ\\x80\\x94upon which\\nmr wemmick set particular value as being to use his own words â\\x80\\x9cevery\\none of â\\x80\\x99em lies sirâ\\x80\\x9d these were agreeably dispersed among small\\nspecimens of china and glass various neat trifles made by the\\nproprietor of the museum and some tobaccostoppers carved by the aged\\nthey were all displayed in that chamber of the castle into which i had\\nbeen first inducted and which served not only as the general\\nsittingroom but as the kitchen too if i might judge from a saucepan\\non the hob and a brazen bijou over the fireplace designed for the\\nsuspension of a roastingjack\\n\\nthere was a neat little girl in attendance who looked after the aged\\nin the day when she had laid the suppercloth the bridge was lowered\\nto give her means of egress and she withdrew for the night the supper\\nwas excellent and though the castle was rather subject to dryrot\\ninsomuch that it tasted like a bad nut and though the pig might have\\nbeen farther off i was heartily pleased with my whole entertainment\\nnor was there any drawback on my little turret bedroom beyond there\\nbeing such a very thin ceiling between me and the flagstaff that when\\ni lay down on my back in bed it seemed as if i had to balance that\\npole on my forehead all night\\n\\nwemmick was up early in the morning and i am afraid i heard him\\ncleaning my boots after that he fell to gardening and i saw him from\\nmy gothic window pretending to employ the aged and nodding at him in a\\nmost devoted manner our breakfast was as good as the supper and at\\nhalfpast eight precisely we started for little britain by degrees\\nwemmick got dryer and harder as we went along and his mouth tightened\\ninto a postoffice again at last when we got to his place of business\\nand he pulled out his key from his coatcollar he looked as\\nunconscious of his walworth property as if the castle and the\\ndrawbridge and the arbour and the lake and the fountain and the aged\\nhad all been blown into space together by the last discharge of the\\nstinger\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter xxvi\\n\\n\\nit fell out as wemmick had told me it would that i had an early\\nopportunity of comparing my guardianâ\\x80\\x99s establishment with that of his\\ncashier and clerk my guardian was in his room washing his hands with\\nhis scented soap when i went into the office from walworth and he\\ncalled me to him and gave me the invitation for myself and friends\\nwhich wemmick had prepared me to receive â\\x80\\x9cno ceremonyâ\\x80\\x9d he stipulated\\nâ\\x80\\x9cand no dinner dress and say tomorrowâ\\x80\\x9d i asked him where we should\\ncome to for i had no idea where he lived and i believe it was in his\\ngeneral objection to make anything like an admission that he replied\\nâ\\x80\\x9ccome here and iâ\\x80\\x99ll take you home with meâ\\x80\\x9d i embrace this opportunity\\nof remarking that he washed his clients off as if he were a surgeon or\\na dentist he had a closet in his room fitted up for the purpose\\nwhich smelt of the scented soap like a perfumerâ\\x80\\x99s shop it had an\\nunusually large jacktowel on a roller inside the door and he would\\nwash his hands and wipe them and dry them all over this towel\\nwhenever he came in from a police court or dismissed a client from his\\nroom when i and my friends repaired to him at six oâ\\x80\\x99clock next day he\\nseemed to have been engaged on a case of a darker complexion than\\nusual for we found him with his head butted into this closet not only\\nwashing his hands but laving his face and gargling his throat and\\neven when he had done all that and had gone all round the jacktowel\\nhe took out his penknife and scraped the case out of his nails before\\nhe put his coat on\\n\\nthere were some people slinking about as usual when we passed out into\\nthe street who were evidently anxious to speak with him but there was\\nsomething so conclusive in the halo of scented soap which encircled his\\npresence that they gave it up for that day as we walked along\\nwestward he was recognised ever and again by some face in the crowd of\\nthe streets and whenever that happened he talked louder to me but he\\nnever otherwise recognised anybody or took notice that anybody\\nrecognised him\\n\\nhe conducted us to gerrard street soho to a house on the south side\\nof that street rather a stately house of its kind but dolefully in\\nwant of painting and with dirty windows he took out his key and\\nopened the door and we all went into a stone hall bare gloomy and\\nlittle used so up a dark brown staircase into a series of three dark\\nbrown rooms on the first floor there were carved garlands on the\\npanelled walls and as he stood among them giving us welcome i know\\nwhat kind of loops i thought they looked like\\n\\ndinner was laid in the best of these rooms the second was his\\ndressingroom the third his bedroom he told us that he held the\\nwhole house but rarely used more of it than we saw the table was\\ncomfortably laidâ\\x80\\x94no silver in the service of courseâ\\x80\\x94and at the side of\\nhis chair was a capacious dumbwaiter with a variety of bottles and\\ndecanters on it and four dishes of fruit for dessert i noticed\\nthroughout that he kept everything under his own hand and distributed\\neverything himself\\n\\nthere was a bookcase in the room i saw from the backs of the books\\nthat they were about evidence criminal law criminal biography\\ntrials acts of parliament and such things the furniture was all very\\nsolid and good like his watchchain it had an official look however\\nand there was nothing merely ornamental to be seen in a corner was a\\nlittle table of papers with a shaded lamp so that he seemed to bring\\nthe office home with him in that respect too and to wheel it out of an\\nevening and fall to work\\n\\nas he had scarcely seen my three companions until nowâ\\x80\\x94for he and i had\\nwalked togetherâ\\x80\\x94he stood on the hearthrug after ringing the bell\\nand took a searching look at them to my surprise he seemed at once to\\nbe principally if not solely interested in drummle\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cpipâ\\x80\\x9d said he putting his large hand on my shoulder and moving me to\\nthe window â\\x80\\x9ci donâ\\x80\\x99t know one from the other whoâ\\x80\\x99s the spiderâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthe spiderâ\\x80\\x9d said i\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthe blotchy sprawly sulky fellowâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthatâ\\x80\\x99s bentley drummleâ\\x80\\x9d i replied â\\x80\\x9cthe one with the delicate face is\\nstartopâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nnot making the least account of â\\x80\\x9cthe one with the delicate faceâ\\x80\\x9d he\\nreturned â\\x80\\x9cbentley drummle is his name is it i like the look of that\\nfellowâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nhe immediately began to talk to drummle not at all deterred by his\\nreplying in his heavy reticent way but apparently led on by it to\\nscrew discourse out of him i was looking at the two when there came\\nbetween me and them the housekeeper with the first dish for the table\\n\\nshe was a woman of about forty i supposedâ\\x80\\x94but i may have thought her\\nyounger than she was rather tall of a lithe nimble figure extremely\\npale with large faded eyes and a quantity of streaming hair i cannot\\nsay whether any diseased affection of the heart caused her lips to be\\nparted as if she were panting and her face to bear a curious\\nexpression of suddenness and flutter but i know that i had been to see\\nmacbeth at the theatre a night or two before and that her face looked\\nto me as if it were all disturbed by fiery air like the faces i had\\nseen rise out of the witchesâ\\x80\\x99 caldron\\n\\nshe set the dish on touched my guardian quietly on the arm with a\\nfinger to notify that dinner was ready and vanished we took our seats\\nat the round table and my guardian kept drummle on one side of him\\nwhile startop sat on the other it was a noble dish of fish that the\\nhousekeeper had put on table and we had a joint of equally choice\\nmutton afterwards and then an equally choice bird sauces wines all\\nthe accessories we wanted and all of the best were given out by our\\nhost from his dumbwaiter and when they had made the circuit of the\\ntable he always put them back again similarly he dealt us clean\\nplates and knives and forks for each course and dropped those just\\ndisused into two baskets on the ground by his chair no other attendant\\nthan the housekeeper appeared she set on every dish and i always saw\\nin her face a face rising out of the caldron years afterwards i made\\na dreadful likeness of that woman by causing a face that had no other\\nnatural resemblance to it than it derived from flowing hair to pass\\nbehind a bowl of flaming spirits in a dark room\\n\\ninduced to take particular notice of the housekeeper both by her own\\nstriking appearance and by wemmickâ\\x80\\x99s preparation i observed that\\nwhenever she was in the room she kept her eyes attentively on my\\nguardian and that she would remove her hands from any dish she put\\nbefore him hesitatingly as if she dreaded his calling her back and\\nwanted him to speak when she was nigh if he had anything to say i\\nfancied that i could detect in his manner a consciousness of this and\\na purpose of always holding her in suspense\\n\\ndinner went off gayly and although my guardian seemed to follow rather\\nthan originate subjects i knew that he wrenched the weakest part of\\nour dispositions out of us for myself i found that i was expressing\\nmy tendency to lavish expenditure and to patronise herbert and to\\nboast of my great prospects before i quite knew that i had opened my\\nlips it was so with all of us but with no one more than drummle the\\ndevelopment of whose inclination to gird in a grudging and suspicious\\nway at the rest was screwed out of him before the fish was taken off\\n\\nit was not then but when we had got to the cheese that our\\nconversation turned upon our rowing feats and that drummle was rallied\\nfor coming up behind of a night in that slow amphibious way of his\\ndrummle upon this informed our host that he much preferred our room to\\nour company and that as to skill he was more than our master and that\\nas to strength he could scatter us like chaff by some invisible\\nagency my guardian wound him up to a pitch little short of ferocity\\nabout this trifle and he fell to baring and spanning his arm to show\\nhow muscular it was and we all fell to baring and spanning our arms in\\na ridiculous manner\\n\\nnow the housekeeper was at that time clearing the table my guardian\\ntaking no heed of her but with the side of his face turned from her\\nwas leaning back in his chair biting the side of his forefinger and\\nshowing an interest in drummle that to me was quite inexplicable\\nsuddenly he clapped his large hand on the housekeeperâ\\x80\\x99s like a trap\\nas she stretched it across the table so suddenly and smartly did he do\\nthis that we all stopped in our foolish contention\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cif you talk of strengthâ\\x80\\x9d said mr jaggers â\\x80\\x9ciâ\\x80\\x99ll show you a wrist\\nmolly let them see your wristâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nher entrapped hand was on the table but she had already put her other\\nhand behind her waist â\\x80\\x9cmasterâ\\x80\\x9d she said in a low voice with her\\neyes attentively and entreatingly fixed upon him â\\x80\\x9cdonâ\\x80\\x99tâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ciâ\\x80\\x99ll show you a wristâ\\x80\\x9d repeated mr jaggers with an immovable\\ndetermination to show it â\\x80\\x9cmolly let them see your wristâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmasterâ\\x80\\x9d she again murmured â\\x80\\x9cpleaseâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmollyâ\\x80\\x9d said mr jaggers not looking at her but obstinately looking\\nat the opposite side of the room â\\x80\\x9clet them see both your wrists\\nshow them comeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nhe took his hand from hers and turned that wrist up on the table she\\nbrought her other hand from behind her and held the two out side by\\nside the last wrist was much disfiguredâ\\x80\\x94deeply scarred and scarred\\nacross and across when she held her hands out she took her eyes from\\nmr jaggers and turned them watchfully on every one of the rest of us\\nin succession\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthereâ\\x80\\x99s power hereâ\\x80\\x9d said mr jaggers coolly tracing out the sinews\\nwith his forefinger â\\x80\\x9cvery few men have the power of wrist that this\\nwoman has itâ\\x80\\x99s remarkable what mere force of grip there is in these\\nhands i have had occasion to notice many hands but i never saw\\nstronger in that respect manâ\\x80\\x99s or womanâ\\x80\\x99s than theseâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nwhile he said these words in a leisurely critical style she continued\\nto look at every one of us in regular succession as we sat the moment\\nhe ceased she looked at him again â\\x80\\x9cthatâ\\x80\\x99ll do mollyâ\\x80\\x9d said mr\\njaggers giving her a slight nod â\\x80\\x9cyou have been admired and can goâ\\x80\\x9d\\nshe withdrew her hands and went out of the room and mr jaggers\\nputting the decanters on from his dumbwaiter filled his glass and\\npassed round the wine\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cat halfpast nine gentlemenâ\\x80\\x9d said he â\\x80\\x9cwe must break up pray make\\nthe best use of your time i am glad to see you all mr drummle i\\ndrink to youâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nif his object in singling out drummle were to bring him out still more\\nit perfectly succeeded in a sulky triumph drummle showed his morose\\ndepreciation of the rest of us in a more and more offensive degree\\nuntil he became downright intolerable through all his stages mr\\njaggers followed him with the same strange interest he actually seemed\\nto serve as a zest to mr jaggersâ\\x80\\x99s wine\\n\\nin our boyish want of discretion i dare say we took too much to drink\\nand i know we talked too much we became particularly hot upon some\\nboorish sneer of drummleâ\\x80\\x99s to the effect that we were too free with\\nour money it led to my remarking with more zeal than discretion that\\nit came with a bad grace from him to whom startop had lent money in my\\npresence but a week or so before\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwellâ\\x80\\x9d retorted drummle â\\x80\\x9cheâ\\x80\\x99ll be paidâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci donâ\\x80\\x99t mean to imply that he wonâ\\x80\\x99tâ\\x80\\x9d said i â\\x80\\x9cbut it might make you\\nhold your tongue about us and our money i should thinkâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou should thinkâ\\x80\\x9d retorted drummle â\\x80\\x9coh lordâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci dare sayâ\\x80\\x9d i went on meaning to be very severe â\\x80\\x9cthat you wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t\\nlend money to any of us if we wanted itâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou are rightâ\\x80\\x9d said drummle â\\x80\\x9ci wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t lend one of you a sixpence\\ni wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t lend anybody a sixpenceâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9crather mean to borrow under those circumstances i should sayâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou should sayâ\\x80\\x9d repeated drummle â\\x80\\x9coh lordâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthis was so very aggravatingâ\\x80\\x94the more especially as i found myself\\nmaking no way against his surly obtusenessâ\\x80\\x94that i said disregarding\\nherbertâ\\x80\\x99s efforts to check meâ\\x80\\x94\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ccome mr drummle since we are on the subject iâ\\x80\\x99ll tell you what\\npassed between herbert here and me when you borrowed that moneyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci donâ\\x80\\x99t want to know what passed between herbert there and youâ\\x80\\x9d\\ngrowled drummle and i think he added in a lower growl that we might\\nboth go to the devil and shake ourselves\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ciâ\\x80\\x99ll tell you howeverâ\\x80\\x9d said i â\\x80\\x9cwhether you want to know or not we\\nsaid that as you put it in your pocket very glad to get it you seemed\\nto be immensely amused at his being so weak as to lend itâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ndrummle laughed outright and sat laughing in our faces with his hands\\nin his pockets and his round shoulders raised plainly signifying that\\nit was quite true and that he despised us as asses all\\n\\nhereupon startop took him in hand though with a much better grace than\\ni had shown and exhorted him to be a little more agreeable startop\\nbeing a lively bright young fellow and drummle being the exact\\nopposite the latter was always disposed to resent him as a direct\\npersonal affront he now retorted in a coarse lumpish way and startop\\ntried to turn the discussion aside with some small pleasantry that made\\nus all laugh resenting this little success more than anything\\ndrummle without any threat or warning pulled his hands out of his\\npockets dropped his round shoulders swore took up a large glass and\\nwould have flung it at his adversaryâ\\x80\\x99s head but for our entertainerâ\\x80\\x99s\\ndexterously seizing it at the instant when it was raised for that\\npurpose\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cgentlemenâ\\x80\\x9d said mr jaggers deliberately putting down the glass and\\nhauling out his gold repeater by its massive chain â\\x80\\x9ci am exceedingly\\nsorry to announce that itâ\\x80\\x99s half past nineâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\non this hint we all rose to depart before we got to the street door\\nstartop was cheerily calling drummle â\\x80\\x9cold boyâ\\x80\\x9d as if nothing had\\nhappened but the old boy was so far from responding that he would not\\neven walk to hammersmith on the same side of the way so herbert and i\\nwho remained in town saw them going down the street on opposite sides\\nstartop leading and drummle lagging behind in the shadow of the\\nhouses much as he was wont to follow in his boat\\n\\nas the door was not yet shut i thought i would leave herbert there for\\na moment and run upstairs again to say a word to my guardian i found\\nhim in his dressingroom surrounded by his stock of boots already hard\\nat it washing his hands of us\\n\\ni told him i had come up again to say how sorry i was that anything\\ndisagreeable should have occurred and that i hoped he would not blame\\nme much\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cpoohâ\\x80\\x9d said he sluicing his face and speaking through the\\nwaterdrops â\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s nothing pip i like that spider thoughâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nhe had turned towards me now and was shaking his head and blowing\\nand towelling himself\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci am glad you like him sirâ\\x80\\x9d said iâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cbut i donâ\\x80\\x99tâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cno noâ\\x80\\x9d my guardian assented â\\x80\\x9cdonâ\\x80\\x99t have too much to do with him\\nkeep as clear of him as you can but i like the fellow pip he is one\\nof the true sort why if i was a fortunetellerâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nlooking out of the towel he caught my eye\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbut i am not a fortunetellerâ\\x80\\x9d he said letting his head drop into a\\nfestoon of towel and towelling away at his two ears â\\x80\\x9cyou know what i\\nam donâ\\x80\\x99t you good night pipâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cgood night sirâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nin about a month after that the spiderâ\\x80\\x99s time with mr pocket was up\\nfor good and to the great relief of all the house but mrs pocket he\\nwent home to the family hole\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter xxvii\\n\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmy dear mr pipâ\\x80\\x94\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci write this by request of mr gargery for to let you know that he is\\ngoing to london in company with mr wopsle and would be glad if\\nagreeable to be allowed to see you he would call at barnardâ\\x80\\x99s hotel\\ntuesday morning at nine oâ\\x80\\x99clock when if not agreeable please leave\\nword your poor sister is much the same as when you left we talk of\\nyou in the kitchen every night and wonder what you are saying and\\ndoing if now considered in the light of a liberty excuse it for the\\nlove of poor old days no more dear mr pip from\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyour ever obliged and affectionate servant\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbiddyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cps he wishes me most particular to write what larks he says you\\nwill understand i hope and do not doubt it will be agreeable to see\\nhim even though a gentleman for you had ever a good heart and he is\\na worthy worthy man i have read him all excepting only the last\\nlittle sentence and he wishes me most particular to write again what\\nlarksâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni received this letter by the post on monday morning and therefore its\\nappointment was for next day let me confess exactly with what feelings\\ni looked forward to joeâ\\x80\\x99s coming\\n\\nnot with pleasure though i was bound to him by so many ties no with\\nconsiderable disturbance some mortification and a keen sense of\\nincongruity if i could have kept him away by paying money i certainly\\nwould have paid money my greatest reassurance was that he was coming\\nto barnardâ\\x80\\x99s inn not to hammersmith and consequently would not fall\\nin bentley drummleâ\\x80\\x99s way i had little objection to his being seen by\\nherbert or his father for both of whom i had a respect but i had the\\nsharpest sensitiveness as to his being seen by drummle whom i held in\\ncontempt so throughout life our worst weaknesses and meannesses are\\nusually committed for the sake of the people whom we most despise\\n\\ni had begun to be always decorating the chambers in some quite\\nunnecessary and inappropriate way or other and very expensive those\\nwrestles with barnard proved to be by this time the rooms were vastly\\ndifferent from what i had found them and i enjoyed the honour of\\noccupying a few prominent pages in the books of a neighbouring\\nupholsterer i had got on so fast of late that i had even started a\\nboy in bootsâ\\x80\\x94top bootsâ\\x80\\x94in bondage and slavery to whom i might have\\nbeen said to pass my days for after i had made the monster out of\\nthe refuse of my washerwomanâ\\x80\\x99s family and had clothed him with a blue\\ncoat canary waistcoat white cravat creamy breeches and the boots\\nalready mentioned i had to find him a little to do and a great deal to\\neat and with both of those horrible requirements he haunted my\\nexistence\\n\\nthis avenging phantom was ordered to be on duty at eight on tuesday\\nmorning in the hall it was two feet square as charged for\\nfloorcloth and herbert suggested certain things for breakfast that he\\nthought joe would like while i felt sincerely obliged to him for being\\nso interested and considerate i had an odd halfprovoked sense of\\nsuspicion upon me that if joe had been coming to see him he\\nwouldnâ\\x80\\x99t have been quite so brisk about it\\n\\nhowever i came into town on the monday night to be ready for joe and\\ni got up early in the morning and caused the sittingroom and\\nbreakfasttable to assume their most splendid appearance unfortunately\\nthe morning was drizzly and an angel could not have concealed the fact\\nthat barnard was shedding sooty tears outside the window like some\\nweak giant of a sweep\\n\\nas the time approached i should have liked to run away but the avenger\\npursuant to orders was in the hall and presently i heard joe on the\\nstaircase i knew it was joe by his clumsy manner of coming\\nupstairsâ\\x80\\x94his state boots being always too big for himâ\\x80\\x94and by the time\\nit took him to read the names on the other floors in the course of his\\nascent when at last he stopped outside our door i could hear his\\nfinger tracing over the painted letters of my name and i afterwards\\ndistinctly heard him breathing in at the keyhole finally he gave a\\nfaint single rap and pepperâ\\x80\\x94such was the compromising name of the\\navenging boyâ\\x80\\x94announced â\\x80\\x9cmr gargeryâ\\x80\\x9d i thought he never would have\\ndone wiping his feet and that i must have gone out to lift him off the\\nmat but at last he came in\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cjoe how are you joeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cpip how air you pipâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nwith his good honest face all glowing and shining and his hat put down\\non the floor between us he caught both my hands and worked them\\nstraight up and down as if i had been the lastpatented pump\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci am glad to see you joe give me your hatâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nbut joe taking it up carefully with both hands like a birdâ\\x80\\x99snest\\nwith eggs in it wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t hear of parting with that piece of property\\nand persisted in standing talking over it in a most uncomfortable way\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhich you have that growedâ\\x80\\x9d said joe â\\x80\\x9cand that swelled and that\\ngentlefolkedâ\\x80\\x9d joe considered a little before he discovered this word\\nâ\\x80\\x9cas to be sure you are a honour to your king and countryâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cand you joe look wonderfully wellâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthank godâ\\x80\\x9d said joe â\\x80\\x9ciâ\\x80\\x99m ekerval to most and your sister sheâ\\x80\\x99s no\\nworse than she were and biddy sheâ\\x80\\x99s ever right and ready and all\\nfriends is no backerder if not no forarder â\\x80\\x99ceptin wopsle heâ\\x80\\x99s had a\\ndropâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nall this time still with both hands taking great care of the\\nbirdâ\\x80\\x99snest joe was rolling his eyes round and round the room and\\nround and round the flowered pattern of my dressinggown\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9chad a drop joeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhy yesâ\\x80\\x9d said joe lowering his voice â\\x80\\x9cheâ\\x80\\x99s left the church and went\\ninto the playacting which the playacting have likeways brought him to\\nlondon along with me and his wish wereâ\\x80\\x9d said joe getting the\\nbirdâ\\x80\\x99snest under his left arm for the moment and groping in it for an\\negg with his right â\\x80\\x9cif no offence as i would â\\x80\\x99and you thatâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni took what joe gave me and found it to be the crumpled playbill of a\\nsmall metropolitan theatre announcing the first appearance in that\\nvery week of â\\x80\\x9cthe celebrated provincial amateur of roscian renown\\nwhose unique performance in the highest tragic walk of our national\\nbard has lately occasioned so great a sensation in local dramatic\\ncirclesâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwere you at his performance joeâ\\x80\\x9d i inquired\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci wereâ\\x80\\x9d said joe with emphasis and solemnity\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwas there a great sensationâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhyâ\\x80\\x9d said joe â\\x80\\x9cyes there certainly were a peck of orangepeel\\npartickler when he see the ghost though i put it to yourself sir\\nwhether it were calcâ\\x80\\x99lated to keep a man up to his work with a good\\nhart to be continiwally cutting in betwixt him and the ghost with\\nâ\\x80\\x9camenâ\\x80\\x9d a man may have had a misfortunâ\\x80\\x99 and been in the churchâ\\x80\\x9d said\\njoe lowering his voice to an argumentative and feeling tone â\\x80\\x9cbut that\\nis no reason why you should put him out at such a time which i\\nmeantersay if the ghost of a manâ\\x80\\x99s own father cannot be allowed to\\nclaim his attention what can sir still more when his mourning â\\x80\\x99at\\nis unfortunately made so small as that the weight of the black feathers\\nbrings it off try to keep it on how you mayâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\na ghostseeing effect in joeâ\\x80\\x99s own countenance informed me that herbert\\nhad entered the room so i presented joe to herbert who held out his\\nhand but joe backed from it and held on by the birdâ\\x80\\x99snest\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyour servant sirâ\\x80\\x9d said joe â\\x80\\x9cwhich i hope as you and pipâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94here his\\neye fell on the avenger who was putting some toast on table and so\\nplainly denoted an intention to make that young gentleman one of the\\nfamily that i frowned it down and confused him moreâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9ci meantersay you\\ntwo gentlemenâ\\x80\\x94which i hope as you get your elths in this close spot\\nfor the present may be a werry good inn according to london opinionsâ\\x80\\x9d\\nsaid joe confidentially â\\x80\\x9cand i believe its character do stand it but\\ni wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t keep a pig in it myselfâ\\x80\\x94not in the case that i wished him\\nto fatten wholesome and to eat with a meller flavour on himâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nhaving borne this flattering testimony to the merits of our\\ndwellingplace and having incidentally shown this tendency to call me\\nâ\\x80\\x9csirâ\\x80\\x9d joe being invited to sit down to table looked all round the\\nroom for a suitable spot on which to deposit his hatâ\\x80\\x94as if it were\\nonly on some very few rare substances in nature that it could find a\\nresting placeâ\\x80\\x94and ultimately stood it on an extreme corner of the\\nchimneypiece from which it ever afterwards fell off at intervals\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cdo you take tea or coffee mr gargeryâ\\x80\\x9d asked herbert who always\\npresided of a morning\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthankee sirâ\\x80\\x9d said joe stiff from head to foot â\\x80\\x9ciâ\\x80\\x99ll take whichever\\nis most agreeable to yourselfâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhat do you say to coffeeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthankee sirâ\\x80\\x9d returned joe evidently dispirited by the proposal\\nâ\\x80\\x9csince you are so kind as make chice of coffee i will not run\\ncontrairy to your own opinions but donâ\\x80\\x99t you never find it a little\\nâ\\x80\\x99eatingâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9csay tea thenâ\\x80\\x9d said herbert pouring it out\\n\\nhere joeâ\\x80\\x99s hat tumbled off the mantelpiece and he started out of his\\nchair and picked it up and fitted it to the same exact spot as if it\\nwere an absolute point of good breeding that it should tumble off again\\nsoon\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhen did you come to town mr gargeryâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwere it yesterday afternoonâ\\x80\\x9d said joe after coughing behind his\\nhand as if he had had time to catch the whoopingcough since he came\\nâ\\x80\\x9cno it were not yes it were yes it were yesterday afternoonâ\\x80\\x9d with\\nan appearance of mingled wisdom relief and strict impartiality\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9chave you seen anything of london yetâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhy yes sirâ\\x80\\x9d said joe â\\x80\\x9cme and wopsle went off straight to look at\\nthe blacking wareâ\\x80\\x99us but we didnâ\\x80\\x99t find that it come up to its\\nlikeness in the red bills at the shop doors which i meantersayâ\\x80\\x9d added\\njoe in an explanatory manner â\\x80\\x9cas it is there drawd too\\narchitectooralooralâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni really believe joe would have prolonged this word mightily\\nexpressive to my mind of some architecture that i know into a perfect\\nchorus but for his attention being providentially attracted by his\\nhat which was toppling indeed it demanded from him a constant\\nattention and a quickness of eye and hand very like that exacted by\\nwicketkeeping he made extraordinary play with it and showed the\\ngreatest skill now rushing at it and catching it neatly as it\\ndropped now merely stopping it midway beating it up and humouring\\nit in various parts of the room and against a good deal of the pattern\\nof the paper on the wall before he felt it safe to close with it\\nfinally splashing it into the slopbasin where i took the liberty of\\nlaying hands upon it\\n\\nillustration\\n\\nas to his shirtcollar and his coatcollar they were perplexing to\\nreflect uponâ\\x80\\x94insoluble mysteries both why should a man scrape himself\\nto that extent before he could consider himself full dressed why\\nshould he suppose it necessary to be purified by suffering for his\\nholiday clothes then he fell into such unaccountable fits of\\nmeditation with his fork midway between his plate and his mouth had\\nhis eyes attracted in such strange directions was afflicted with such\\nremarkable coughs sat so far from the table and dropped so much more\\nthan he ate and pretended that he hadnâ\\x80\\x99t dropped it that i was\\nheartily glad when herbert left us for the city\\n\\ni had neither the good sense nor the good feeling to know that this was\\nall my fault and that if i had been easier with joe joe would have\\nbeen easier with me i felt impatient of him and out of temper with\\nhim in which condition he heaped coals of fire on my head\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cus two being now alone sirâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94began joe\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cjoeâ\\x80\\x9d i interrupted pettishly â\\x80\\x9chow can you call me sirâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\njoe looked at me for a single instant with something faintly like\\nreproach utterly preposterous as his cravat was and as his collars\\nwere i was conscious of a sort of dignity in the look\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cus two being now aloneâ\\x80\\x9d resumed joe â\\x80\\x9cand me having the intentions\\nand abilities to stay not many minutes more i will now\\nconcludeâ\\x80\\x94leastways beginâ\\x80\\x94to mention what have led to my having had the\\npresent honour for was it notâ\\x80\\x9d said joe with his old air of lucid\\nexposition â\\x80\\x9cthat my only wish were to be useful to you i should not\\nhave had the honour of breaking wittles in the company and abode of\\ngentlemenâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni was so unwilling to see the look again that i made no remonstrance\\nagainst this tone\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwell sirâ\\x80\\x9d pursued joe â\\x80\\x9cthis is how it were i were at the bargemen\\ntâ\\x80\\x99other night

which that same\\nidenticalâ\\x80\\x9d said joe going down a new track â\\x80\\x9cdo comb my â\\x80\\x99air the\\nwrong way sometimes awful by giving out up and down town as it were\\nhim which ever had your infant companionation and were looked upon as a\\nplayfellow by yourselfâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnonsense it was you joeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhich i fully believed it were

looked at joe i hope one remote cause of\\nits firing may have been my consciousness that if i had known his\\nerrand i should have given him more encouragement\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbiddyâ\\x80\\x9d

fashion of his dress could no more come in its way when he\\nspoke these words than it could come in its way in heaven he touched\\nme gently on the forehead and went out as soon as i could recover\\nmyself sufficiently i hurried out after him and looked for him in the\\nneighbouring streets but he was gone\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter xxviii\\n\\n\\nit was clear that i must repair to our town next day and in the first\\nflow of my repentance it was equally clear that i must stay at joeâ\\x80\\x99s\\nbut when i had secured my boxplace by tomorrowâ\\x80\\x99s coach and had been\\ndown to mr pocketâ\\x80\\x99s and back i was not by any means convinced on the\\nlast point and began to invent reasons and make excuses for putting up\\nat the blue boar i should be an inconvenience at joeâ\\x80\\x99s i was not\\nexpected and my bed would not be ready i should be too far from miss\\nhavishamâ\\x80\\x99s and she was exacting and mightnâ\\x80\\x99t like it all other\\nswindlers upon earth are nothing to the selfswindlers and with such\\npretences did i cheat myself surely a curious thing that i should\\ninnocently take a bad halfcrown of somebody elseâ\\x80\\x99s manufacture is\\nreasonable enough but that i should knowingly reckon the spurious coin\\nof my own make as good money an obliging stranger under pretence of\\ncompactly folding up my banknotes for securityâ\\x80\\x99s sake abstracts the\\nnotes and gives me nutshells but what is his sleight of hand to mine\\nwhen i fold up my own nutshells and pass them on myself as notes\\n\\nhaving settled that i must go to the blue boar my mind was much\\ndisturbed by indecision whether or not to take the avenger it was\\ntempting to think of that expensive mercenary publicly airing his boots\\nin the archway of the blue boarâ\\x80\\x99s postingyard it was almost solemn to\\nimagine him casually produced in the tailorâ\\x80\\x99s shop and confounding the\\ndisrespectful senses of trabbâ\\x80\\x99s boy on the other hand trabbâ\\x80\\x99s boy\\nmight worm himself into his intimacy and tell him things or reckless\\nand desperate wretch as i knew he could be might hoot him in the high\\nstreet my patroness too might hear of him and not approve on the\\nwhole i resolved to leave the avenger behind\\n\\nit was the afternoon coach by which i had taken my place and as\\nwinter had now come round i should not arrive at my destination until\\ntwo or three hours after dark our time of starting from the cross keys\\nwas two oâ\\x80\\x99clock i arrived on the ground with a quarter of an hour to\\nspare attended by the avengerâ\\x80\\x94if i may connect that expression with\\none who never attended on me if he could possibly help it\\n\\nat that time it was customary to carry convicts down to the dockyards\\nby stagecoach as i had often heard of them in the capacity of outside\\npassengers and had more than once seen them on the high road dangling\\ntheir ironed legs over the coach roof i had no cause to be surprised\\nwhen herbert meeting me in the yard came up and told me there were\\ntwo convicts going down with me but i had a reason that was an old\\nreason now for constitutionally faltering whenever i heard the word\\nâ\\x80\\x9cconvictâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou donâ\\x80\\x99t mind them handelâ\\x80\\x9d said herbert\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9co noâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci thought you seemed as if you didnâ\\x80\\x99t like themâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci canâ\\x80\\x99t pretend that i do like them and i suppose you donâ\\x80\\x99t\\nparticularly but i donâ\\x80\\x99t mind themâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9csee there they areâ\\x80\\x9d said herbert â\\x80\\x9ccoming out of the tap what a\\ndegraded and vile sight it isâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthey had been treating their guard i suppose for they had a gaoler\\nwith them and all three came out wiping their mouths on their hands\\nthe two convicts were handcuffed together and had irons on their\\nlegsâ\\x80\\x94irons of a pattern that i knew well they wore the dress that i\\nlikewise knew well their keeper had a brace of pistols and carried a\\nthickknobbed bludgeon under his arm but he was on terms of good\\nunderstanding with them and stood with them beside him looking on at\\nthe puttingto of the horses rather with an air as if the convicts\\nwere an interesting exhibition not formally open at the moment and he\\nthe curator one was a taller and stouter man than the other and\\nappeared as a matter of course according to the mysterious ways of the\\nworld both convict and free to have had allotted to him the smaller\\nsuit of clothes his arms and legs were like great pincushions of those\\nshapes and his attire disguised him absurdly but i knew his\\nhalfclosed eye at one glance there stood the man whom i had seen on\\nthe settle at the three jolly bargemen on a saturday night and who had\\nbrought me down with his invisible gun\\n\\nit was easy to make sure that as yet he knew me no more than if he had\\nnever seen me in his life he looked across at me and his eye\\nappraised my watchchain and then he incidentally spat and said\\nsomething to the other convict and they laughed and slued themselves\\nround with a clink of their coupling manacle and looked at something\\nelse the great numbers on their backs as if they were street doors\\ntheir coarse mangy ungainly outer surface as if they were lower\\nanimals their ironed legs apologetically garlanded with\\npockethandkerchiefs and the way in which all present looked at them\\nand kept from them made them as herbert had said a most disagreeable\\nand degraded spectacle\\n\\nbut this was not the worst of it it came out that the whole of the\\nback of the coach had been taken by a family removing from london and\\nthat there were no places for the two prisoners but on the seat in\\nfront behind the coachman hereupon a choleric gentleman who had\\ntaken the fourth place on that seat flew into a most violent passion\\nand said that it was a breach of contract to mix him up with such\\nvillainous company and that it was poisonous and pernicious and\\ninfamous and shameful and i donâ\\x80\\x99t know what else at this time the\\ncoach was ready and the coachman impatient and we were all preparing\\nto get up and the prisoners had come over with their keeperâ\\x80\\x94bringing\\nwith them that curious flavour of breadpoultice baize ropeyarn and\\nhearthstone which attends the convict presence\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cdonâ\\x80\\x99t take it so much amiss sirâ\\x80\\x9d pleaded the keeper to the angry\\npassenger â\\x80\\x9ciâ\\x80\\x99ll sit next you myself iâ\\x80\\x99ll put â\\x80\\x99em on the outside of\\nthe row they wonâ\\x80\\x99t interfere with you sir you neednâ\\x80\\x99t know theyâ\\x80\\x99re\\nthereâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cand donâ\\x80\\x99t blame meâ\\x80\\x9d growled the convict i had recognised â\\x80\\x9ci\\ndonâ\\x80\\x99t want to go i am quite ready to stay behind as fur as i am\\nconcerned any oneâ\\x80\\x99s welcome to my placeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cor mineâ\\x80\\x9d said the other gruffly â\\x80\\x9ci wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t have incommoded none\\nof you if iâ\\x80\\x99d had my wayâ\\x80\\x9d then they both laughed and began\\ncracking nuts and spitting the shells aboutâ\\x80\\x94as i really think i\\nshould have liked to do myself if i had been in their place and so\\ndespised\\n\\nat length it was voted that there was no help for the angry gentleman\\nand that he must either go in his chance company or remain behind so\\nhe got into his place still making complaints and the keeper got into\\nthe place next him and the convicts hauled themselves up as well as\\nthey could and the convict i had recognised sat behind me with his\\nbreath on the hair of my head\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cgoodbye handelâ\\x80\\x9d herbert called out as we started i thought what a\\nblessed fortune it was that he had found another name for me than pip\\n\\nit is impossible to express with what acuteness i felt the convictâ\\x80\\x99s\\nbreathing not only on the back of my head but all along my spine the\\nsensation was like being touched in the marrow with some pungent and\\nsearching acid it set my very teeth on edge he seemed to have more\\nbreathing business to do than another man and to make more noise in\\ndoing it and i was conscious of growing highshouldered on one side\\nin my shrinking endeavours to fend him off\\n\\nthe weather was miserably raw and the two cursed the cold it made us\\nall lethargic before we had gone far and when we had left the halfway\\nhouse behind we habitually dozed and shivered and were silent i dozed\\noff myself in considering the question whether i ought to restore a\\ncouple of pounds sterling to this creature before losing sight of him\\nand how it could best be done in the act of dipping forward as if i\\nwere going to bathe among the horses i woke in a fright and took the\\nquestion up again\\n\\nbut i must have lost it longer than i had thought since although i\\ncould recognise nothing in the darkness and the fitful lights and\\nshadows of our lamps i traced marsh country in the cold damp wind that\\nblew at us cowering forward for warmth and to make me a screen against\\nthe wind the convicts were closer to me than before the very first\\nwords i heard them interchange as i became conscious were the words of\\nmy own thought â\\x80\\x9ctwo one pound notesâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9chow did he get â\\x80\\x99emâ\\x80\\x9d said the convict i had never seen\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9chow should i knowâ\\x80\\x9d returned the other â\\x80\\x9che had â\\x80\\x99em stowed away\\nsomehows giv him by friends i expectâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci wishâ\\x80\\x9d said the other with a bitter curse upon the cold â\\x80\\x9cthat i\\nhad â\\x80\\x99em hereâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ctwo one pound notes or friendsâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ctwo one pound notes iâ\\x80\\x99d sell all the friends i ever had for one and\\nthink it a blessed good bargain well so he saysâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cso he saysâ\\x80\\x9d resumed the convict i had recognisedâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cit was all said\\nand done in half a minute behind a pile of timber in the\\ndockyardâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x98youâ\\x80\\x99re agoing to be dischargedâ\\x80\\x99 yes i was would i find\\nout that boy that had fed him and kep his secret and give him them two\\none pound notes yes i would and i didâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmore fool youâ\\x80\\x9d growled the other â\\x80\\x9ciâ\\x80\\x99d have spent â\\x80\\x99em on a man in\\nwittles and drink he must have been a green one mean to say he knowed\\nnothing of youâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnot a haâ\\x80\\x99porth different gangs and different ships he was tried\\nagain for prison breaking and got made a liferâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cand was thatâ\\x80\\x94honourâ\\x80\\x94the only time you worked out in this part of the\\ncountryâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthe only timeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhat might have been your opinion of the placeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ca most beastly place mudbank mist swamp and work work swamp\\nmist and mudbankâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthey both execrated the place in very strong language and gradually\\ngrowled themselves out and had nothing left to say\\n\\nafter overhearing this dialogue i should assuredly have got down and\\nbeen left in the solitude and darkness of the highway but for feeling\\ncertain that the man had no suspicion of my identity indeed i was not\\nonly so changed in the course of nature but so differently dressed and\\nso differently circumstanced that it was not at all likely he could\\nhave known me without accidental help still the coincidence of our\\nbeing together on the coach was sufficiently strange to fill me with a\\ndread that some other coincidence might at any moment connect me in\\nhis hearing with my name for this reason i resolved to alight as\\nsoon as we touched the town and put myself out of his hearing this\\ndevice i executed successfully my little portmanteau was in the boot\\nunder my feet i had but to turn a hinge to get it out i threw it down\\nbefore me got down after it and was left at the first lamp on the\\nfirst stones of the town pavement as to the convicts they went their\\nway with the coach and i knew at what point they would be spirited off\\nto the river in my fancy i saw the boat with its convict crew waiting\\nfor them at the slimewashed stairsâ\\x80\\x94again heard the gruff â\\x80\\x9cgive way\\nyouâ\\x80\\x9d like and order to dogsâ\\x80\\x94again saw the wicked noahâ\\x80\\x99s ark lying out\\non the black water\\n\\ni could not have said what i was afraid of for my fear was altogether\\nundefined and vague but there was great fear upon me as i walked on\\nto the hotel i felt that a dread much exceeding the mere apprehension\\nof a painful or disagreeable recognition made me tremble i am\\nconfident that it took no distinctness of shape and that it was the\\nrevival for a few minutes of the terror of childhood\\n\\nthe coffeeroom at the blue boar was empty and i had not only ordered\\nmy dinner there but had sat down to it before the waiter knew me as\\nsoon as he had apologised for the remissness of his memory he asked me\\nif he should send boots for mr pumblechook\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnoâ\\x80\\x9d said i â\\x80\\x9ccertainly notâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthe waiter it was he who had brought up the great remonstrance from\\nthe commercials on the day when i was bound appeared surprised and\\ntook the earliest opportunity of putting a dirty old copy of a local\\nnewspaper so directly in my way that i took it up and read this\\nparagraphâ\\x80\\x94\\n\\nour readers will learn not altogether without interest in reference\\nto the recent romantic rise in fortune of a young artificer in iron of\\nthis neighbourhood what a theme by the way for the magic pen of our\\nas yet not universally acknowledged townsman tooby the poet of our\\ncolumns that the youthâ\\x80\\x99s earliest patron companion and friend was\\na highly respected individual not entirely unconnected with the corn\\nand seed trade and whose eminently convenient and commodious business\\npremises are situate within a hundred miles of the high street it is\\nnot wholly irrespective of our personal feelings that we record him as\\nthe mentor of our young telemachus for it is good to know that our\\ntown produced the founder of the latterâ\\x80\\x99s fortunes does the\\nthoughtcontracted brow of the local sage or the lustrous eye of local\\nbeauty inquire whose fortunes we believe that quintin matsys was the\\nblacksmith of antwerp verb sap\\n\\ni entertain a conviction based upon large experience that if in the\\ndays of my prosperity i had gone to the north pole i should have met\\nsomebody there wandering esquimaux or civilized man who would have\\ntold me that pumblechook was my earliest patron and the founder of my\\nfortunes\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter xxix\\n\\n\\nbetimes in the morning i was up and out it was too early yet to go to\\nmiss havishamâ\\x80\\x99s so i loitered into the country on miss havishamâ\\x80\\x99s side\\nof townâ\\x80\\x94which was not joeâ\\x80\\x99s side i could go there tomorrowâ\\x80\\x94thinking\\nabout my patroness and painting brilliant pictures of her plans for\\nme\\n\\nshe had adopted estella she had as good as adopted me and it could\\nnot fail to be her intention to bring us together she reserved it for\\nme to restore the desolate house admit the sunshine into the dark\\nrooms set the clocks agoing and the cold hearths ablazing tear down\\nthe cobwebs destroy the verminâ\\x80\\x94in short do all the shining deeds of\\nthe young knight of romance and marry the princess i had stopped to\\nlook at the house as i passed and its seared red brick walls blocked\\nwindows and strong green ivy clasping even the stacks of chimneys with\\nits twigs and tendons as if with sinewy old arms had made up a rich\\nattractive mystery of which i was the hero estella was the\\ninspiration of it and the heart of it of course but though she had\\ntaken such strong possession of me though my fancy and my hope were so\\nset upon her though her influence on my boyish life and character had\\nbeen allpowerful i did not even that romantic morning invest her\\nwith any attributes save those she possessed i mention this in this\\nplace of a fixed purpose because it is the clue by which i am to be\\nfollowed into my poor labyrinth according to my experience the\\nconventional notion of a lover cannot be always true the unqualified\\ntruth is that when i loved estella with the love of a man i loved her\\nsimply because i found her irresistible once for all i knew to my\\nsorrow often and often if not always that i loved her against\\nreason against promise against peace against hope against\\nhappiness against all discouragement that could be once for all i\\nloved her none the less because i knew it and it had no more influence\\nin restraining me than if i had devoutly believed her to be human\\nperfection\\n\\ni so shaped out my walk as to arrive at the gate at my old time when i\\nhad rung at the bell with an unsteady hand i turned my back upon the\\ngate while i tried to get my breath and keep the beating of my heart\\nmoderately quiet i heard the sidedoor open and steps come across the\\ncourtyard but i pretended not to hear even when the gate swung on its\\nrusty hinges\\n\\nbeing at last touched on the shoulder i started and turned i started\\nmuch more naturally then to find myself confronted by a man in a sober\\ngrey dress the last man i should have expected to see in that place of\\nporter at miss havishamâ\\x80\\x99s door\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9corlickâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cah young master thereâ\\x80\\x99s more changes than yours but come in come\\nin itâ\\x80\\x99s opposed to my orders to hold the gate openâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni entered and he swung it and locked it and took the key out â\\x80\\x9cyesâ\\x80\\x9d\\nsaid he facing round after doggedly preceding me a few steps towards\\nthe house â\\x80\\x9chere i amâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9chow did you come hereâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci come hereâ\\x80\\x9d he retorted â\\x80\\x9con my legs i had my box brought alongside\\nme in a barrowâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9care you here for goodâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci ainâ\\x80\\x99t here for harm young master i supposeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni was not so sure of that i had leisure to entertain the retort in my\\nmind while he slowly lifted his heavy glance from the pavement up my\\nlegs and arms to my face\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthen you have left the forgeâ\\x80\\x9d i said\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cdo this look like a forgeâ\\x80\\x9d replied orlick sending his glance all\\nround him with an air of injury â\\x80\\x9cnow do it look like itâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni asked him how long he had left gargeryâ\\x80\\x99s forge\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cone day is so like another hereâ\\x80\\x9d he replied â\\x80\\x9cthat i donâ\\x80\\x99t know\\nwithout casting it up however i come here some time since you leftâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci could have told you that orlickâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cahâ\\x80\\x9d said he dryly â\\x80\\x9cbut then youâ\\x80\\x99ve got to be a scholarâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nby this time we had come to the house where i found his room to be one\\njust within the sidedoor with a little window in it looking on the\\ncourtyard in its small proportions it was not unlike the kind of\\nplace usually assigned to a gateporter in paris certain keys were\\nhanging on the wall to which he now added the gate key and his\\npatchworkcovered bed was in a little inner division or recess the\\nwhole had a slovenly confined and sleepy look like a cage for a\\nhuman dormouse while he looming dark and heavy in the shadow of a\\ncorner by the window looked like the human dormouse for whom it was\\nfitted upâ\\x80\\x94as indeed he was\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci never saw this room beforeâ\\x80\\x9d i remarked â\\x80\\x9cbut there used to be no\\nporter hereâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnoâ\\x80\\x9d said he â\\x80\\x9cnot till it got about that there was no protection on\\nthe premises and it come to be considered dangerous with convicts and\\ntag and rag and bobtail going up and down and then i was recommended\\nto the place as a man who could give another man as good as he brought\\nand i took it itâ\\x80\\x99s easier than bellowsing and hammeringâ\\x80\\x94thatâ\\x80\\x99s\\nloaded that isâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nmy eye had been caught by a gun with a brassbound stock over the\\nchimneypiece and his eye had followed mine\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwellâ\\x80\\x9d said i not desirous of more conversation â\\x80\\x9cshall i go up to\\nmiss havishamâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cburn me if i knowâ\\x80\\x9d he retorted first stretching himself and then\\nshaking himself â\\x80\\x9cmy orders ends here young master i give this here\\nbell a rap with this here hammer and you go on along the passage till\\nyou meet somebodyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci am expected i believeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cburn me twice over if i can sayâ\\x80\\x9d said he\\n\\nupon that i turned down the long passage which i had first trodden in\\nmy thick boots and he made his bell sound at the end of the passage\\nwhile the bell was still reverberating i found sarah pocket who\\nappeared to have now become constitutionally green and yellow by reason\\nof me\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cohâ\\x80\\x9d said she â\\x80\\x9cyou is it mr pipâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cit is miss pocket i am glad to tell you that mr pocket and family\\nare all wellâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9care they any wiserâ\\x80\\x9d said sarah with a dismal shake of the head\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthey had better be wiser than well ah matthew matthew you know\\nyour way sirâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ntolerably for i had gone up the staircase in the dark many a time i\\nascended it now in lighter boots than of yore and tapped in my old\\nway at the door of miss havishamâ\\x80\\x99s room â\\x80\\x9cpipâ\\x80\\x99s rapâ\\x80\\x9d i heard her say\\nimmediately â\\x80\\x9ccome in pipâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nshe was in her chair near the old table in the old dress with her two\\nhands crossed on her stick her chin resting on them and her eyes on\\nthe fire sitting near her with the white shoe that had never been\\nworn in her hand and her head bent as she looked at it was an\\nelegant lady whom i had never seen\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ccome in pipâ\\x80\\x9d miss havisham continued to mutter without looking\\nround or up â\\x80\\x9ccome in pip how do you do pip so you kiss my hand as\\nif i were a queen ehâ\\x80\\x94wellâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nshe looked up at me suddenly only moving her eyes and repeated in a\\ngrimly playful mannerâ\\x80\\x94\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwellâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci heard miss havishamâ\\x80\\x9d said i rather at a loss â\\x80\\x9cthat you were so\\nkind as to wish me to come and see you and i came directlyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwellâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthe lady whom i had never seen before lifted up her eyes and looked\\narchly at me and then i saw that the eyes were estellaâ\\x80\\x99s eyes but she\\nwas so much changed was so much more beautiful so much more womanly\\nin all things winning admiration had made such wonderful advance that\\ni seemed to have made none i fancied as i looked at her that i\\nslipped hopelessly back into the coarse and common boy again o the\\nsense of distance and disparity that came upon me and the\\ninaccessibility that came about her\\n\\nshe gave me her hand i stammered something about the pleasure i felt\\nin seeing her again and about my having looked forward to it for a\\nlong long time\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cdo you find her much changed pipâ\\x80\\x9d asked miss havisham with her\\ngreedy look and striking her stick upon a chair that stood between\\nthem as a sign to me to sit down there\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhen i came in miss havisham i thought there was nothing of estella\\nin the face or figure but now it all settles down so curiously into\\nthe oldâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhat you are not going to say into the old estellaâ\\x80\\x9d miss havisham\\ninterrupted â\\x80\\x9cshe was proud and insulting and you wanted to go away\\nfrom her donâ\\x80\\x99t you rememberâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni said confusedly that that was long ago and that i knew no better\\nthen and the like estella smiled with perfect composure and said she\\nhad no doubt of my having been quite right and of her having been very\\ndisagreeable\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cis he changedâ\\x80\\x9d miss havisham asked her\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cvery muchâ\\x80\\x9d said estella looking at me\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cless coarse and commonâ\\x80\\x9d said miss havisham playing with estellaâ\\x80\\x99s\\nhair\\n\\nestella laughed and looked at the shoe in her hand and laughed again\\nand looked at me and put the shoe down she treated me as a boy still\\nbut she lured me on\\n\\nwe sat in the dreamy room among the old strange influences which had so\\nwrought upon me and i learnt that she had but just come home from\\nfrance and that she was going to london proud and wilful as of old\\nshe had brought those qualities into such subjection to her beauty that\\nit was impossible and out of natureâ\\x80\\x94or i thought soâ\\x80\\x94to separate them\\nfrom her beauty truly it was impossible to dissociate her presence\\nfrom all those wretched hankerings after money and gentility that had\\ndisturbed my boyhoodâ\\x80\\x94from all those illregulated aspirations that had\\nfirst made me ashamed of home and joeâ\\x80\\x94from all those visions that had\\nraised her face in the glowing fire struck it out of the iron on the\\nanvil extracted it from the darkness of night to look in at the wooden\\nwindow of the forge and flit away in a word it was impossible for me\\nto separate her in the past or in the present from the innermost life\\nof my life\\n\\nit was settled that i should stay there all the rest of the day and\\nreturn to the hotel at night and to london tomorrow when we had\\nconversed for a while miss havisham sent us two out to walk in the\\nneglected garden on our coming in by and by she said i should wheel\\nher about a little as in times of yore\\n\\nso estella and i went out into the garden by the gate through which i\\nhad strayed to my encounter with the pale young gentleman now herbert\\ni trembling in spirit and worshipping the very hem of her dress she\\nquite composed and most decidedly not worshipping the hem of mine as\\nwe drew near to the place of encounter she stopped and saidâ\\x80\\x94\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci must have been a singular little creature to hide and see that fight\\nthat day but i did and i enjoyed it very muchâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou rewarded me very muchâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cdid iâ\\x80\\x9d she replied in an incidental and forgetful way â\\x80\\x9ci remember i\\nentertained a great objection to your adversary because i took it ill\\nthat he should be brought here to pester me with his companyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9che and i are great friends nowâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9care you i think i recollect though that you read with his fatherâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyesâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni made the admission with reluctance for it seemed to have a boyish\\nlook and she already treated me more than enough like a boy\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9csince your change of fortune and prospects you have changed your\\ncompanionsâ\\x80\\x9d said estella\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnaturallyâ\\x80\\x9d said i\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cand necessarilyâ\\x80\\x9d she added in a haughty tone â\\x80\\x9cwhat was fit company\\nfor you once would be quite unfit company for you nowâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nin my conscience i doubt very much whether i had any lingering\\nintention left of going to see joe but if i had this observation put\\nit to flight\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou had no idea of your impending good fortune in those timesâ\\x80\\x9d said\\nestella with a slight wave of her hand signifying in the fighting\\ntimes\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnot the leastâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthe air of completeness and superiority with which she walked at my\\nside and the air of youthfulness and submission with which i walked at\\nhers made a contrast that i strongly felt it would have rankled in me\\nmore than it did if i had not regarded myself as eliciting it by being\\nso set apart for her and assigned to her\\n\\nthe garden was too overgrown and rank for walking in with ease and\\nafter we had made the round of it twice or thrice we came out again\\ninto the brewery yard i showed her to a nicety where i had seen her\\nwalking on the casks that first old day and she said with a cold and\\ncareless look in that direction â\\x80\\x9cdid iâ\\x80\\x9d i reminded her where she had\\ncome out of the house and given me my meat and drink and she said â\\x80\\x9ci\\ndonâ\\x80\\x99t rememberâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cnot remember that you made me cryâ\\x80\\x9d said i â\\x80\\x9cnoâ\\x80\\x9d\\nsaid she and shook her head and looked about her i verily believe\\nthat her not remembering and not minding in the least made me cry\\nagain inwardlyâ\\x80\\x94and that is the sharpest crying of all\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou must knowâ\\x80\\x9d said estella condescending to me as a brilliant and\\nbeautiful woman might â\\x80\\x9cthat i have no heartâ\\x80\\x94if that has anything to\\ndo with my memoryâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni got through some jargon to the effect that i took the liberty of\\ndoubting that that i knew better that there could be no such beauty\\nwithout it\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9coh i have a heart to be stabbed in or shot in i have no doubtâ\\x80\\x9d said\\nestella â\\x80\\x9cand of course if it ceased to beat i should cease to be but\\nyou know what i mean i have no softness there\\nnoâ\\x80\\x94sympathyâ\\x80\\x94sentimentâ\\x80\\x94nonsenseâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nwhat was it that was borne in upon my mind when she stood still and\\nlooked attentively at me anything that i had seen in miss havisham\\nno in some of her looks and gestures there was that tinge of\\nresemblance to miss havisham which may often be noticed to have been\\nacquired by children from grown person with whom they have been much\\nassociated and secluded and which when childhood is passed will\\nproduce a remarkable occasional likeness of expression between faces\\nthat are otherwise quite different and yet i could not trace this to\\nmiss havisham i looked again and though she was still looking at me\\nthe suggestion was gone\\n\\nwhat was it\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci am seriousâ\\x80\\x9d said estella not so much with a frown for her brow\\nwas smooth as with a darkening of her face â\\x80\\x9cif we are to be thrown\\nmuch together you had better believe it at once noâ\\x80\\x9d imperiously\\nstopping me as i opened my lips â\\x80\\x9ci have not bestowed my tenderness\\nanywhere i have never had any such thingâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nin another moment we were in the brewery so long disused and she\\npointed to the high gallery where i had seen her going out on that same\\nfirst day and told me she remembered to have been up there and to\\nhave seen me standing scared below as my eyes followed her white hand\\nagain the same dim suggestion that i could not possibly grasp crossed\\nme my involuntary start occasioned her to lay her hand upon my arm\\ninstantly the ghost passed once more and was gone\\n\\nwhat was it\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhat is the matterâ\\x80\\x9d asked estella â\\x80\\x9care you scared againâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci should be if i believed what you said just nowâ\\x80\\x9d i replied to turn\\nit off\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthen you donâ\\x80\\x99t very well it is said at any rate miss havisham will\\nsoon be expecting you at your old post though i think that might be\\nlaid aside now with other old belongings let us make one more round\\nof the garden and then go in come you shall not shed tears for my\\ncruelty today you shall be my page and give me your shoulderâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nher handsome dress had trailed upon the ground she held it in one hand\\nnow and with the other lightly touched my shoulder as we walked we\\nwalked round the ruined garden twice or thrice more and it was all in\\nbloom for me if the green and yellow growth of weed in the chinks of\\nthe old wall had been the most precious flowers that ever blew it\\ncould not have been more cherished in my remembrance\\n\\nthere was no discrepancy of years between us to remove her far from me\\nwe were of nearly the same age though of course the age told for more\\nin her case than in mine but the air of inaccessibility which her\\nbeauty and her manner gave her tormented me in the midst of my\\ndelight and at the height of the assurance i felt that our patroness\\nhad chosen us for one another wretched boy\\n\\nat last we went back into the house and there i heard with surprise\\nthat my guardian had come down to see miss havisham on business and\\nwould come back to dinner the old wintry branches of chandeliers in\\nthe room where the mouldering table was spread had been lighted while\\nwe were out and miss havisham was in her chair and waiting for me\\n\\nit was like pushing the chair itself back into the past when we began\\nthe old slow circuit round about the ashes of the bridal feast but in\\nthe funereal room with that figure of the grave fallen back in the\\nchair fixing its eyes upon her estella looked more bright and\\nbeautiful than before and i was under stronger enchantment\\n\\nthe time so melted away that our early dinnerhour drew close at hand\\nand estella left us to prepare herself we had stopped near the centre\\nof the long table and miss havisham with one of her withered arms\\nstretched out of the chair rested that clenched hand upon the yellow\\ncloth as estella looked back over her shoulder before going out at the\\ndoor miss havisham kissed that hand to her with a ravenous intensity\\nthat was of its kind quite dreadful\\n\\nthen estella being gone and we two left alone she turned to me and\\nsaid in a whisperâ\\x80\\x94\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cis she beautiful graceful wellgrown do you admire herâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ceverybody must who sees her miss havishamâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nshe drew an arm round my neck and drew my head close down to hers as\\nshe sat in the chair â\\x80\\x9clove her love her love her how does she use\\nyouâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nbefore i could answer if i could have answered so difficult a question\\nat all she repeated â\\x80\\x9clove her love her love her if she favours\\nyou love her if she wounds you love her if she tears your heart to\\npiecesâ\\x80\\x94and as it gets older and stronger it will tear deeperâ\\x80\\x94love\\nher love her love herâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nnever had i seen such passionate eagerness as was joined to her\\nutterance of these words i could feel the muscles of the thin arm\\nround my neck swell with the vehemence that possessed her\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9chear me pip i adopted her to be loved i bred her and educated her\\nto be loved i developed her into what she is that she might be loved\\nlove herâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nshe said the word often enough and there could be no doubt that she\\nmeant to say it but if the often repeated word had been hate instead\\nof loveâ\\x80\\x94despairâ\\x80\\x94revengeâ\\x80\\x94dire deathâ\\x80\\x94it could not have sounded from her\\nlips more like a curse\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ciâ\\x80\\x99ll tell youâ\\x80\\x9d said she in the same hurried passionate whisper\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhat real love is it is blind devotion unquestioning\\nselfhumiliation utter submission trust and belief against yourself\\nand against the whole world giving up your whole heart and soul to the\\nsmiterâ\\x80\\x94as i didâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nwhen she came to that and to a wild cry that followed that i caught\\nher round the waist for she rose up in the chair in her shroud of a\\ndress and struck at the air as if she would as soon have struck\\nherself against the wall and fallen dead\\n\\nall this passed in a few seconds as i drew her down into her chair i\\nwas conscious of a scent that i knew and turning saw my guardian in\\nthe room\\n\\nhe always carried i have not yet mentioned it i think a\\npockethandkerchief of rich silk and of imposing proportions which was\\nof great value to him in his profession i have seen him so terrify a\\nclient or a witness by ceremoniously unfolding this pockethandkerchief\\nas if he were immediately going to blow his nose and then pausing as\\nif he knew he should not have time to do it before such client or\\nwitness committed himself that the selfcommittal has followed\\ndirectly quite as a matter of course when i saw him in the room he\\nhad this expressive pockethandkerchief in both hands and was looking\\nat us on meeting my eye he said plainly by a momentary and silent\\npause in that attitude â\\x80\\x9cindeed singularâ\\x80\\x9d and then put the\\nhandkerchief to its right use with wonderful effect\\n\\nmiss havisham had seen him as soon as i and was like everybody else\\nafraid of him she made a strong attempt to compose herself and\\nstammered that he was as punctual as ever\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cas punctual as everâ\\x80\\x9d he repeated coming up to us â\\x80\\x9chow do you do\\npip shall i give you a ride miss havisham once round and so you\\nare here pipâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni told him when i had arrived and how miss havisham had wished me to\\ncome and see estella to which he replied â\\x80\\x9cah very fine young ladyâ\\x80\\x9d\\nthen he pushed miss havisham in her chair before him with one of his\\nlarge hands and put the other in his trouserspocket as if the pocket\\nwere full of secrets\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwell pip how often have you seen miss estella beforeâ\\x80\\x9d said he when\\nhe came to a stop\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9chow oftenâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cah how many times ten thousand timesâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9coh certainly not so manyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ctwiceâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cjaggersâ\\x80\\x9d interposed miss havisham much to my relief â\\x80\\x9cleave my pip\\nalone and go with him to your dinnerâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nhe complied and we groped our way down the dark stairs together while\\nwe were still on our way to those detached apartments across the paved\\nyard at the back he asked me how often i had seen miss havisham eat\\nand drink offering me a breadth of choice as usual between a hundred\\ntimes and once\\n\\ni considered and said â\\x80\\x9cneverâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cand never will pipâ\\x80\\x9d he retorted with a frowning smile â\\x80\\x9cshe has\\nnever allowed herself to be seen doing either since she lived this\\npresent life of hers she wanders about in the night and then lays\\nhands on such food as she takesâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cpray sirâ\\x80\\x9d said i â\\x80\\x9cmay i ask you a questionâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou mayâ\\x80\\x9d said he â\\x80\\x9cand i may decline to answer it put your\\nquestionâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cestellaâ\\x80\\x99s name is it havisham orâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d i had nothing to add\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cor whatâ\\x80\\x9d said he\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cis it havishamâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cit is havishamâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthis brought us to the dinnertable where she and sarah pocket awaited\\nus mr jaggers presided estella sat opposite to him i faced my green\\nand yellow friend we dined very well and were waited on by a\\nmaidservant whom i had never seen in all my comings and goings but\\nwho for anything i know had been in that mysterious house the whole\\ntime after dinner a bottle of choice old port was placed before my\\nguardian he was evidently well acquainted with the vintage and the\\ntwo ladies left us\\n\\nanything to equal the determined reticence of mr jaggers under that\\nroof i never saw elsewhere even in him he kept his very looks to\\nhimself and scarcely directed his eyes to estellaâ\\x80\\x99s face once during\\ndinner when she spoke to him he listened and in due course answered\\nbut never looked at her that i could see on the other hand she often\\nlooked at him with interest and curiosity if not distrust but his\\nface never showed the least consciousness throughout dinner he took a\\ndry delight in making sarah pocket greener and yellower by often\\nreferring in conversation with me to my expectations but here again\\nhe showed no consciousness and even made it appear that he\\nextortedâ\\x80\\x94and even did extort though i donâ\\x80\\x99t know howâ\\x80\\x94those references\\nout of my innocent self\\n\\nand when he and i were left alone together he sat with an air upon him\\nof general lying by in consequence of information he possessed that\\nreally was too much for me he crossexamined his very wine when he had\\nnothing else in hand he held it between himself and the candle tasted\\nthe port rolled it in his mouth swallowed it looked at his glass\\nagain smelt the port tried it drank it filled again and\\ncrossexamined the glass again until i was as nervous as if i had\\nknown the wine to be telling him something to my disadvantage three or\\nfour times i feebly thought i would start conversation but whenever he\\nsaw me going to ask him anything he looked at me with his glass in his\\nhand and rolling his wine about in his mouth as if requesting me to\\ntake notice that it was of no use for he couldnâ\\x80\\x99t answer\\n\\ni think miss pocket was conscious that the sight of me involved her in\\nthe danger of being goaded to madness and perhaps tearing off her\\ncapâ\\x80\\x94which was a very hideous one in the nature of a muslin mopâ\\x80\\x94and\\nstrewing the ground with her hairâ\\x80\\x94which assuredly had never grown on\\nher head she did not appear when we afterwards went up to miss\\nhavishamâ\\x80\\x99s room and we four played at whist in the interval miss\\nhavisham in a fantastic way had put some of the most beautiful jewels\\nfrom her dressingtable into estellaâ\\x80\\x99s hair and about her bosom and\\narms and i saw even my guardian look at her from under his thick\\neyebrows and raise them a little when her loveliness was before him\\nwith those rich flushes of glitter and colour in it\\n\\nillustration\\n\\nof the manner and extent to which he took our trumps into custody and\\ncame out with mean little cards at the ends of hands before which the\\nglory of our kings and queens was utterly abased i say nothing nor\\nof the feeling that i had respecting his looking upon us personally in\\nthe light of three very obvious and poor riddles that he had found out\\nlong ago what i suffered from was the incompatibility between his\\ncold presence and my feelings towards estella it was not that i knew i\\ncould never bear to speak to him about her that i knew i could never\\nbear to hear him creak his boots at her that i knew i could never bear\\nto see him wash his hands of her it was that my admiration should be\\nwithin a foot or two of himâ\\x80\\x94it was that my feelings should be in the\\nsame place with himâ\\x80\\x94that was the agonizing circumstance\\n\\nwe played until nine oâ\\x80\\x99clock and then it was arranged that when\\nestella came to london i should be forewarned of her coming and should\\nmeet her at the coach and then i took leave of her and touched her\\nand left her\\n\\nmy guardian lay at the boar in the next room to mine far into the\\nnight miss havishamâ\\x80\\x99s words â\\x80\\x9clove her love her love herâ\\x80\\x9d sounded\\nin my ears i adapted them for my own repetition and said to my\\npillow â\\x80\\x9ci love her i love her i love herâ\\x80\\x9d hundreds of times then\\na burst of gratitude came upon me that she should be destined for me\\nonce the blacksmithâ\\x80\\x99s boy then i thought if she were as i feared by\\nno means rapturously grateful for that destiny yet when would she\\nbegin to be interested in me when should i awaken the heart within her\\nthat was mute and sleeping now\\n\\nah me i thought those were high and great emotions but i never\\nthought there was anything low and small in my keeping away from joe\\nbecause i knew she would be contemptuous of him it was but a day gone\\nand joe had brought the tears into my eyes they had soon dried god\\nforgive me soon dried\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter xxx\\n\\n\\nafter well considering the matter while i was dressing at the blue boar\\nin the morning i resolved to tell my guardian that i doubted orlickâ\\x80\\x99s\\nbeing the right sort of man to fill a post of trust at miss havishamâ\\x80\\x99s\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhy of course he is not the right sort of man pipâ\\x80\\x9d said my guardian\\ncomfortably satisfied beforehand on the general head â\\x80\\x9cbecause the man\\nwho fills the post of trust never is the right sort of manâ\\x80\\x9d it seemed\\nquite to put him into spirits to find that this particular post was not\\nexceptionally held by the right sort of man and he listened in a\\nsatisfied manner while i told him what knowledge i had of orlick â\\x80\\x9cvery\\ngood pipâ\\x80\\x9d he observed when i had concluded â\\x80\\x9ciâ\\x80\\x99ll go round\\npresently and pay our friend offâ\\x80\\x9d rather alarmed by this summary\\naction i was for a little delay and even hinted that our friend\\nhimself might be difficult to deal with â\\x80\\x9coh no he wonâ\\x80\\x99tâ\\x80\\x9d said my\\nguardian making his pockethandkerchiefpoint with perfect\\nconfidence â\\x80\\x9ci should like to see him argue the question with meâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nas we were going back together to london by the midday coach and as i\\nbreakfasted under such terrors of pumblechook that i could scarcely\\nhold my cup this gave me an opportunity of saying that i wanted a\\nwalk and that i would go on along the london road while mr jaggers\\nwas occupied if he would let the coachman know that i would get into\\nmy place when overtaken i was thus enabled to fly from the blue boar\\nimmediately after breakfast by then making a loop of about a couple of\\nmiles into the open country at the back of pumblechookâ\\x80\\x99s premises i\\ngot round into the high street again a little beyond that pitfall and\\nfelt myself in comparative security\\n\\nit was interesting to be in the quiet old town once more and it was\\nnot disagreeable to be here and there suddenly recognised and stared\\nafter one or two of the tradespeople even darted out of their shops\\nand went a little way down the street before me that they might turn\\nas if they had forgotten something and pass me face to faceâ\\x80\\x94on which\\noccasions i donâ\\x80\\x99t know whether they or i made the worse pretence they\\nof not doing it or i of not seeing it still my position was a\\ndistinguished one and i was not at all dissatisfied with it until\\nfate threw me in the way of that unlimited miscreant trabbâ\\x80\\x99s boy\\n\\ncasting my eyes along the street at a certain point of my progress i\\nbeheld trabbâ\\x80\\x99s boy approaching lashing himself with an empty blue bag\\ndeeming that a serene and unconscious contemplation of him would best\\nbeseem me and would be most likely to quell his evil mind i advanced\\nwith that expression of countenance and was rather congratulating\\nmyself on my success when suddenly the knees of trabbâ\\x80\\x99s boy smote\\ntogether his hair uprose his cap fell off he trembled violently in\\nevery limb staggered out into the road and crying to the populace\\nâ\\x80\\x9chold me iâ\\x80\\x99m so frightenedâ\\x80\\x9d feigned to be in a paroxysm of terror and\\ncontrition occasioned by the dignity of my appearance as i passed\\nhim his teeth loudly chattered in his head and with every mark of\\nextreme humiliation he prostrated himself in the dust\\n\\nthis was a hard thing to bear but this was nothing i had not advanced\\nanother two hundred yards when to my inexpressible terror amazement\\nand indignation i again beheld trabbâ\\x80\\x99s boy approaching he was coming\\nround a narrow corner his blue bag was slung over his shoulder honest\\nindustry beamed in his eyes a determination to proceed to trabbâ\\x80\\x99s with\\ncheerful briskness was indicated in his gait with a shock he became\\naware of me and was severely visited as before but this time his\\nmotion was rotatory and he staggered round and round me with knees\\nmore afflicted and with uplifted hands as if beseeching for mercy his\\nsufferings were hailed with the greatest joy by a knot of spectators\\nand i felt utterly confounded\\n\\ni had not got as much further down the street as the postoffice when\\ni again beheld trabbâ\\x80\\x99s boy shooting round by a back way this time he\\nwas entirely changed he wore the blue bag in the manner of my\\ngreatcoat and was strutting along the pavement towards me on the\\nopposite side of the street attended by a company of delighted young\\nfriends to whom he from time to time exclaimed with a wave of his\\nhand â\\x80\\x9cdonâ\\x80\\x99t know yahâ\\x80\\x9d words cannot state the amount of aggravation\\nand injury wreaked upon me by trabbâ\\x80\\x99s boy when passing abreast of me\\nhe pulled up his shirtcollar twined his sidehair stuck an arm\\nakimbo and smirked extravagantly by wriggling his elbows and body\\nand drawling to his attendants â\\x80\\x9cdonâ\\x80\\x99t know yah donâ\\x80\\x99t know yah â\\x80\\x99pon\\nmy soul donâ\\x80\\x99t know yahâ\\x80\\x9d the disgrace attendant on his immediately\\nafterwards taking to crowing and pursuing me across the bridge with\\ncrows as from an exceedingly dejected fowl who had known me when i was\\na blacksmith culminated the disgrace with which i left the town and\\nwas so to speak ejected by it into the open country\\n\\nillustration\\n\\nbut unless i had taken the life of trabbâ\\x80\\x99s boy on that occasion i\\nreally do not even now see what i could have done save endure to have\\nstruggled with him in the street or to have exacted any lower\\nrecompense from him than his heartâ\\x80\\x99s best blood would have been futile\\nand degrading moreover he was a boy whom no man could hurt an\\ninvulnerable and dodging serpent who when chased into a corner flew\\nout again between his captorâ\\x80\\x99s legs scornfully yelping i wrote\\nhowever to mr trabb by next dayâ\\x80\\x99s post to say that mr pip must\\ndecline to deal further with one who could so far forget what he owed\\nto the best interests of society as to employ a boy who excited\\nloathing in every respectable mind\\n\\nthe coach with mr jaggers inside came up in due time and i took my\\nboxseat again and arrived in london safeâ\\x80\\x94but not sound for my heart\\nwas gone as soon as i arrived i sent a penitential codfish and barrel\\nof oysters to joe as reparation for not having gone myself and then\\nwent on to barnardâ\\x80\\x99s inn\\n\\ni found herbert dining on cold meat and delighted to welcome me back\\nhaving despatched the avenger to the coffeehouse for an addition to\\nthe dinner i felt that i must open my breast that very evening to my\\nfriend and chum as confidence was out of the question with the avenger\\nin the hall which could merely be regarded in the light of an\\nantechamber to the keyhole i sent him to the play a better proof of\\nthe severity of my bondage to that taskmaster could scarcely be\\nafforded than the degrading shifts to which i was constantly driven to\\nfind him employment so mean is extremity that i sometimes sent him to\\nhyde park corner to see what oâ\\x80\\x99clock it was\\n\\ndinner done and we sitting with our feet upon the fender i said to\\nherbert â\\x80\\x9cmy dear herbert i have something very particular to tell\\nyouâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmy dear handelâ\\x80\\x9d he returned â\\x80\\x9ci shall esteem and respect your\\nconfidenceâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cit concerns myself herbertâ\\x80\\x9d said i â\\x80\\x9cand one other personâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nherbert crossed his feet looked at the fire with his head on one side\\nand having looked at it in vain for some time looked at me because i\\ndidnâ\\x80\\x99t go on\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cherbertâ\\x80\\x9d said i laying my hand upon his knee â\\x80\\x9ci loveâ\\x80\\x94i\\nadoreâ\\x80\\x94estellaâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ninstead of being transfixed herbert replied in an easy\\nmatterofcourse way â\\x80\\x9cexactly wellâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwell herbert is that all you say wellâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhat next i meanâ\\x80\\x9d said herbert â\\x80\\x9cof course i know thatâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9chow do you know itâ\\x80\\x9d said i\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9chow do i know it handel why from youâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci never told youâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ctold me you have never told me when you have got your hair cut but i\\nhave had senses to perceive it you have always adored her ever since\\ni have known you you brought your adoration and your portmanteau here\\ntogether told me why you have always told me all day long when you\\ntold me your own story you told me plainly that you began adoring her\\nthe first time you saw her when you were very young indeedâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cvery well thenâ\\x80\\x9d said i to whom this was a new and not unwelcome\\nlight â\\x80\\x9ci have never left off adoring her and she has come back a\\nmost beautiful and most elegant creature and i saw her yesterday and\\nif i adored her before i now doubly adore herâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9clucky for you then handelâ\\x80\\x9d said herbert â\\x80\\x9cthat you are picked out\\nfor her and allotted to her without encroaching on forbidden ground\\nwe may venture to say that there can be no doubt between ourselves of\\nthat fact have you any idea yet of estellaâ\\x80\\x99s views on the adoration\\nquestionâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni shook my head gloomily â\\x80\\x9coh she is thousands of miles away from\\nmeâ\\x80\\x9d said i\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cpatience my dear handel time enough time enough but you have\\nsomething more to sayâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci am ashamed to say itâ\\x80\\x9d i returned â\\x80\\x9cand yet itâ\\x80\\x99s no worse to say it\\nthan to think it you call me a lucky fellow of course i am i was a\\nblacksmithâ\\x80\\x99s boy but yesterday i amâ\\x80\\x94what shall i say i amâ\\x80\\x94todayâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9csay a good fellow if you want a phraseâ\\x80\\x9d returned herbert smiling\\nand clapping his hand on the back of mineâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9ca good fellow with\\nimpetuosity and hesitation boldness and diffidence action and\\ndreaming curiously mixed in himâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni stopped for a moment to consider whether there really was this\\nmixture in my character on the whole i by no means recognised the\\nanalysis but thought it not worth disputing\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhen i ask what i am to call myself today herbertâ\\x80\\x9d i went on â\\x80\\x9ci\\nsuggest what i have in my thoughts you say i am lucky i know i have\\ndone nothing to raise myself in life and that fortune alone has raised\\nme that is being very lucky and yet when i think of estellaâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cand when donâ\\x80\\x99t you you knowâ\\x80\\x9d herbert threw in with his eyes on the\\nfire which i thought kind and sympathetic of him\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x94then my dear herbert i cannot tell you how dependent and uncertain\\ni feel and how exposed to hundreds of chances avoiding forbidden\\nground as you did just now i may still say that on the constancy of\\none person naming no person all my expectations depend and at the\\nbest how indefinite and unsatisfactory only to know so vaguely what\\nthey areâ\\x80\\x9d in saying this i relieved my mind of what had always been\\nthere more or less though no doubt most since yesterday\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnow handelâ\\x80\\x9d herbert replied in his gay hopeful way â\\x80\\x9cit seems to\\nme that in the despondency of the tender passion we are looking into\\nour gifthorseâ\\x80\\x99s mouth with a magnifyingglass likewise it seems to\\nme that concentrating our attention on the examination we altogether\\noverlook one of the best points of the animal didnâ\\x80\\x99t you tell me that\\nyour guardian mr jaggers told you in the beginning that you were\\nnot endowed with expectations only and even if he had not told you\\nsoâ\\x80\\x94though that is a very large if i grantâ\\x80\\x94could you believe that of\\nall men in london mr jaggers is the man to hold his present relations\\ntowards you unless he were sure of his groundâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni said i could not deny that this was a strong point i said it people\\noften do so in such cases like a rather reluctant concession to truth\\nand justiceâ\\x80\\x94as if i wanted to deny it\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci should think it was a strong pointâ\\x80\\x9d said herbert â\\x80\\x9cand i should\\nthink you would be puzzled to imagine a stronger as to the rest you\\nmust bide your guardianâ\\x80\\x99s time and he must bide his clientâ\\x80\\x99s time\\nyouâ\\x80\\x99ll be oneandtwenty before you know where you are and then\\nperhaps youâ\\x80\\x99ll get some further enlightenment at all events youâ\\x80\\x99ll be\\nnearer getting it for it must come at lastâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhat a hopeful disposition you haveâ\\x80\\x9d said i gratefully admiring his\\ncheery ways\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci ought to haveâ\\x80\\x9d said herbert â\\x80\\x9cfor i have not much else i must\\nacknowledge by the by that the good sense of what i have just said is\\nnot my own but my fatherâ\\x80\\x99s the only remark i ever heard him make on\\nyour story was the final one â\\x80\\x9cthe thing is settled and done or mr\\njaggers would not be in itâ\\x80\\x9d and now before i say anything more about\\nmy father or my fatherâ\\x80\\x99s son and repay confidence with confidence i\\nwant to make myself seriously disagreeable to you for a\\nmomentâ\\x80\\x94positively repulsiveâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou wonâ\\x80\\x99t succeedâ\\x80\\x9d said i\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9co yes i shallâ\\x80\\x9d said he â\\x80\\x9cone two three and now i am in for it\\nhandel my good fellowâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94though he spoke in this light tone he was\\nvery much in earnestâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9ci have been thinking since we have been talking\\nwith our feet on this fender that estella surely cannot be a condition\\nof your inheritance if she was never referred to by your guardian am\\ni right in so understanding what you have told me as that he never\\nreferred to her directly or indirectly in any way never even hinted\\nfor instance that your patron might have views as to your marriage\\nultimatelyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cneverâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnow handel i am quite free from the flavour of sour grapes upon my\\nsoul and honour not being bound to her can you not detach yourself\\nfrom herâ\\x80\\x94i told you i should be disagreeableâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni turned my head aside for with a rush and a sweep like the old\\nmarsh winds coming up from the sea a feeling like that which had\\nsubdued me on the morning when i left the forge when the mists were\\nsolemnly rising and when i laid my hand upon the village fingerpost\\nsmote upon my heart again there was silence between us for a little\\nwhile\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyes but my dear handelâ\\x80\\x9d herbert went on as if we had been talking\\ninstead of silent â\\x80\\x9cits having been so strongly rooted in the breast of\\na boy whom nature and circumstances made so romantic renders it very\\nserious think of her bringingup and think of miss havisham think of\\nwhat she is herself now i am repulsive and you abominate me this may\\nlead to miserable thingsâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci know it herbertâ\\x80\\x9d said i with my head still turned away â\\x80\\x9cbut i\\ncanâ\\x80\\x99t help itâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou canâ\\x80\\x99t detach yourselfâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cno impossibleâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou canâ\\x80\\x99t try handelâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cno impossibleâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwellâ\\x80\\x9d said herbert getting up with a lively shake as if he had been\\nasleep and stirring the fire â\\x80\\x9cnow iâ\\x80\\x99ll endeavour to make myself\\nagreeable againâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nso he went round the room and shook the curtains out put the chairs in\\ntheir places tidied the books and so forth that were lying about\\nlooked into the hall peeped into the letterbox shut the door and\\ncame back to his chair by the fire where he sat down nursing his left\\nleg in both arms\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci was going to say a word or two handel concerning my father and my\\nfatherâ\\x80\\x99s son i am afraid it is scarcely necessary for my fatherâ\\x80\\x99s son\\nto remark that my fatherâ\\x80\\x99s establishment is not particularly brilliant\\nin its housekeepingâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthere is always plenty herbertâ\\x80\\x9d said i to say something\\nencouraging\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9co yes and so the dustman says i believe with the strongest\\napproval and so does the marinestore shop in the back street\\ngravely handel for the subject is grave enough you know how it is as\\nwell as i do i suppose there was a time once when my father had not\\ngiven matters up but if ever there was the time is gone may i ask\\nyou if you have ever had an opportunity of remarking down in your part\\nof the country that the children of not exactly suitable marriages are\\nalways most particularly anxious to be marriedâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthis was such a singular question that i asked him in return â\\x80\\x9cis it\\nsoâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci donâ\\x80\\x99t knowâ\\x80\\x9d said herbert â\\x80\\x9cthatâ\\x80\\x99s what i want to know because it\\nis decidedly the case with us my poor sister charlotte who was next\\nme and died before she was fourteen was a striking example little\\njane is the same in her desire to be matrimonially established you\\nmight suppose her to have passed her short existence in the perpetual\\ncontemplation of domestic bliss little alick in a frock has already\\nmade arrangements for his union with a suitable young person at kew\\nand indeed i think we are all engaged except the babyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthen you areâ\\x80\\x9d said i\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci amâ\\x80\\x9d said herbert â\\x80\\x9cbut itâ\\x80\\x99s a secretâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni assured him of my keeping the secret and begged to be favoured with\\nfurther particulars he had spoken so sensibly and feelingly of my\\nweakness that i wanted to know something about his strength\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmay i ask the nameâ\\x80\\x9d i said\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cname of claraâ\\x80\\x9d said herbert\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9clive in londonâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyes perhaps i ought to mentionâ\\x80\\x9d said herbert who had become\\ncuriously crestfallen and meek since we entered on the interesting\\ntheme â\\x80\\x9cthat she is rather below my motherâ\\x80\\x99s nonsensical family\\nnotions her father had to do with the victualling of passengerships\\ni think he was a species of purserâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhat is he nowâ\\x80\\x9d said i\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cheâ\\x80\\x99s an invalid nowâ\\x80\\x9d replied herbert\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cliving onâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9con the first floorâ\\x80\\x9d said herbert which was not at all what i meant\\nfor i had intended my question to apply to his means â\\x80\\x9ci have never\\nseen him for he has always kept his room overhead since i have known\\nclara but i have heard him constantly he makes tremendous\\nrowsâ\\x80\\x94roars and pegs at the floor with some frightful instrumentâ\\x80\\x9d in\\nlooking at me and then laughing heartily herbert for the time\\nrecovered his usual lively manner\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cdonâ\\x80\\x99t you expect to see himâ\\x80\\x9d said i\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9co yes i constantly expect to see himâ\\x80\\x9d returned herbert â\\x80\\x9cbecause i\\nnever hear him without expecting him to come tumbling through the\\nceiling but i donâ\\x80\\x99t know how long the rafters may holdâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nwhen he had once more laughed heartily he became meek again and told\\nme that the moment he began to realise capital it was his intention to\\nmarry this young lady he added as a selfevident proposition\\nengendering low spirits â\\x80\\x9cbut you canâ\\x80\\x99t marry you know while youâ\\x80\\x99re\\nlooking about youâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nas we contemplated the fire and as i thought what a difficult vision\\nto realise this same capital sometimes was i put my hands in my\\npockets a folded piece of paper in one of them attracting my\\nattention i opened it and found it to be the playbill i had received\\nfrom joe relative to the celebrated provincial amateur of roscian\\nrenown â\\x80\\x9cand bless my heartâ\\x80\\x9d i involuntarily added aloud â\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s\\ntonightâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthis changed the subject in an instant and made us hurriedly resolve\\nto go to the play so when i had pledged myself to comfort and abet\\nherbert in the affair of his heart by all practicable and impracticable\\nmeans and when herbert had told me that his affianced already knew me\\nby reputation and that i should be presented to her and when we had\\nwarmly shaken hands upon our mutual confidence we blew out our\\ncandles made up our fire locked our door and issued forth in quest\\nof mr wopsle and denmark\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter xxxi\\n\\n\\non our arrival in denmark we found the king and queen of that country\\nelevated in two armchairs on a kitchentable holding a court the\\nwhole of the danish nobility were in attendance consisting of a noble\\nboy in the washleather boots of a gigantic ancestor a venerable peer\\nwith a dirty face who seemed to have risen from the people late in\\nlife and the danish chivalry with a comb in its hair and a pair of\\nwhite silk legs and presenting on the whole a feminine appearance my\\ngifted townsman stood gloomily apart with folded arms and i could\\nhave wished that his curls and forehead had been more probable\\n\\nseveral curious little circumstances transpired as the action\\nproceeded the late king of the country not only appeared to have been\\ntroubled with a cough at the time of his decease but to have taken it\\nwith him to the tomb and to have brought it back the royal phantom\\nalso carried a ghostly manuscript round its truncheon to which it had\\nthe appearance of occasionally referring and that too with an air of\\nanxiety and a tendency to lose the place of reference which were\\nsuggestive of a state of mortality it was this i conceive which led\\nto the shadeâ\\x80\\x99s being advised by the gallery to â\\x80\\x9cturn overâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94a\\nrecommendation which it took extremely ill it was likewise to be noted\\nof this majestic spirit that whereas it always appeared with an air of\\nhaving been out a long time and walked an immense distance it\\nperceptibly came from a closely contiguous wall this occasioned its\\nterrors to be received derisively the queen of denmark a very buxom\\nlady though no doubt historically brazen was considered by the public\\nto have too much brass about her her chin being attached to her diadem\\nby a broad band of that metal as if she had a gorgeous toothache her\\nwaist being encircled by another and each of her arms by another so\\nthat she was openly mentioned as â\\x80\\x9cthe kettledrumâ\\x80\\x9d the noble boy in\\nthe ancestral boots was inconsistent representing himself as it were\\nin one breath as an able seaman a strolling actor a gravedigger a\\nclergyman and a person of the utmost importance at a court\\nfencingmatch on the authority of whose practised eye and nice\\ndiscrimination the finest strokes were judged this gradually led to a\\nwant of toleration for him and evenâ\\x80\\x94on his being detected in holy\\norders and declining to perform the funeral serviceâ\\x80\\x94to the general\\nindignation taking the form of nuts lastly ophelia was a prey to such\\nslow musical madness that when in course of time she had taken off\\nher white muslin scarf folded it up and buried it a sulky man who\\nhad been long cooling his impatient nose against an iron bar in the\\nfront row of the gallery growled â\\x80\\x9cnow the babyâ\\x80\\x99s put to bed letâ\\x80\\x99s\\nhave supperâ\\x80\\x9d which to say the least of it was out of keeping\\n\\nupon my unfortunate townsman all these incidents accumulated with\\nplayful effect whenever that undecided prince had to ask a question or\\nstate a doubt the public helped him out with it as for example on\\nthe question whether â\\x80\\x99twas nobler in the mind to suffer some roared\\nyes and some no and some inclining to both opinions said â\\x80\\x9ctoss up for\\nitâ\\x80\\x9d and quite a debating society arose when he asked what should such\\nfellows as he do crawling between earth and heaven he was encouraged\\nwith loud cries of â\\x80\\x9chear hearâ\\x80\\x9d when he appeared with his stocking\\ndisordered its disorder expressed according to usage by one very\\nneat fold in the top which i suppose to be always got up with a flat\\niron a conversation took place in the gallery respecting the paleness\\nof his leg and whether it was occasioned by the turn the ghost had\\ngiven him on his taking the recordersâ\\x80\\x94very like a little black flute\\nthat had just been played in the orchestra and handed out at the\\ndoorâ\\x80\\x94he was called upon unanimously for rule britannia when he\\nrecommended the player not to saw the air thus the sulky man said\\nâ\\x80\\x9cand donâ\\x80\\x99t you do it neither youâ\\x80\\x99re a deal worse than himâ\\x80\\x9d and i\\ngrieve to add that peals of laughter greeted mr wopsle on every one of\\nthese occasions\\n\\nbut his greatest trials were in the churchyard which had the\\nappearance of a primeval forest with a kind of small ecclesiastical\\nwashhouse on one side and a turnpike gate on the other mr wopsle in\\na comprehensive black cloak being descried entering at the turnpike\\nthe gravedigger was admonished in a friendly way â\\x80\\x9clook out hereâ\\x80\\x99s the\\nundertaker a coming to see how youâ\\x80\\x99re a getting on with your workâ\\x80\\x9d i\\nbelieve it is well known in a constitutional country that mr wopsle\\ncould not possibly have returned the skull after moralizing over it\\nwithout dusting his fingers on a white napkin taken from his breast\\nbut even that innocent and indispensable action did not pass without\\nthe comment â\\x80\\x9cwaiterâ\\x80\\x9d the arrival of the body for interment in an\\nempty black box with the lid tumbling open was the signal for a\\ngeneral joy which was much enhanced by the discovery among the\\nbearers of an individual obnoxious to identification the joy attended\\nmr wopsle through his struggle with laertes on the brink of the\\norchestra and the grave and slackened no more until he had tumbled the\\nking off the kitchentable and had died by inches from the ankles\\nupward\\n\\nwe had made some pale efforts in the beginning to applaud mr wopsle\\nbut they were too hopeless to be persisted in therefore we had sat\\nfeeling keenly for him but laughing nevertheless from ear to ear i\\nlaughed in spite of myself all the time the whole thing was so droll\\nand yet i had a latent impression that there was something decidedly\\nfine in mr wopsleâ\\x80\\x99s elocutionâ\\x80\\x94not for old associationsâ\\x80\\x99 sake i am\\nafraid but because it was very slow very dreary very uphill and\\ndownhill and very unlike any way in which any man in any natural\\ncircumstances of life or death ever expressed himself about anything\\nwhen the tragedy was over and he had been called for and hooted i\\nsaid to herbert â\\x80\\x9clet us go at once or perhaps we shall meet himâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nwe made all the haste we could downstairs but we were not quick enough\\neither standing at the door was a jewish man with an unnatural heavy\\nsmear of eyebrow who caught my eyes as we advanced and said when we\\ncame up with himâ\\x80\\x94\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmr pip and friendâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nidentity of mr pip and friend confessed\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmr waldengarverâ\\x80\\x9d said the man â\\x80\\x9cwould be glad to have the honourâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwaldengarverâ\\x80\\x9d i repeatedâ\\x80\\x94when herbert murmured in my ear â\\x80\\x9cprobably\\nwopsleâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cohâ\\x80\\x9d said i â\\x80\\x9cyes shall we follow youâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ca few steps pleaseâ\\x80\\x9d when we were in a side alley he turned and\\nasked â\\x80\\x9chow did you think he lookedâ\\x80\\x94i dressed himâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni donâ\\x80\\x99t know what he had looked like except a funeral with the\\naddition of a large danish sun or star hanging round his neck by a blue\\nribbon that had given him the appearance of being insured in some\\nextraordinary fire office but i said he had looked very nice\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhen he come to the graveâ\\x80\\x9d said our conductor â\\x80\\x9che showed his cloak\\nbeautiful but judging from the wing it looked to me that when he see\\nthe ghost in the queenâ\\x80\\x99s apartment he might have made more of his\\nstockingsâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni modestly assented and we all fell through a little dirty swing door\\ninto a sort of hot packingcase immediately behind it here mr wopsle\\nwas divesting himself of his danish garments and here there was just\\nroom for us to look at him over one anotherâ\\x80\\x99s shoulders by keeping the\\npackingcase door or lid wide open\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cgentlemenâ\\x80\\x9d said mr wopsle â\\x80\\x9ci am proud to see you i hope mr pip\\nyou will excuse my sending round i had the happiness to know you in\\nformer times and the drama has ever had a claim which has ever been\\nacknowledged on the noble and the affluentâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nmeanwhile mr waldengarver in a frightful perspiration was trying to\\nget himself out of his princely sables\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cskin the stockings off mr waldengarverâ\\x80\\x9d said the owner of that\\nproperty â\\x80\\x9cor youâ\\x80\\x99ll bust â\\x80\\x99em bust â\\x80\\x99em and youâ\\x80\\x99ll bust\\nfiveandthirty shillings shakspeare never was complimented with a\\nfiner pair keep quiet in your chair now and leave â\\x80\\x99em to meâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nwith that he went upon his knees and began to flay his victim who\\non the first stocking coming off would certainly have fallen over\\nbackward with his chair but for there being no room to fall anyhow\\n\\ni had been afraid until then to say a word about the play but then\\nmr waldengarver looked up at us complacently and saidâ\\x80\\x94\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cgentlemen how did it seem to you to go in frontâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nherbert said from behind at the same time poking me â\\x80\\x9ccapitallyâ\\x80\\x9d so\\ni said â\\x80\\x9ccapitallyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9chow did you like my reading of the character gentlemenâ\\x80\\x9d said mr\\nwaldengarver almost if not quite with patronage\\n\\nherbert said from behind again poking me â\\x80\\x9cmassive and concreteâ\\x80\\x9d so\\ni said boldly as if i had originated it and must beg to insist upon\\nit â\\x80\\x9cmassive and concreteâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci am glad to have your approbation gentlemenâ\\x80\\x9d said mr waldengarver\\nwith an air of dignity in spite of his being ground against the wall\\nat the time and holding on by the seat of the chair\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbut iâ\\x80\\x99ll tell you one thing mr waldengarverâ\\x80\\x9d said the man who was\\non his knees â\\x80\\x9cin which youâ\\x80\\x99re out in your reading now mind i donâ\\x80\\x99t\\ncare who says contrairy i tell you so youâ\\x80\\x99re out in your reading of\\nhamlet when you get your legs in profile the last hamlet as i dressed\\nmade the same mistakes in his reading at rehearsal till i got him to\\nput a large red wafer on each of his shins and then at that rehearsal\\nwhich was the last i went in front sir to the back of the pit and\\nwhenever his reading brought him into profile i called out â\\x80\\x9ci donâ\\x80\\x99t\\nsee no wafersâ\\x80\\x9d and at night his reading was lovelyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nmr waldengarver smiled at me as much as to say â\\x80\\x9ca faithful\\ndependentâ\\x80\\x94i overlook his follyâ\\x80\\x9d and then said aloud â\\x80\\x9cmy view is a\\nlittle classic and thoughtful for them here but they will improve\\nthey will improveâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nherbert and i said together o no doubt they would improve\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cdid you observe gentlemenâ\\x80\\x9d said mr waldengarver â\\x80\\x9cthat there was a\\nman in the gallery who endeavoured to cast derision on the serviceâ\\x80\\x94i\\nmean the representationâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nwe basely replied that we rather thought we had noticed such a man i\\nadded â\\x80\\x9che was drunk no doubtâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9co dear no sirâ\\x80\\x9d said mr wopsle â\\x80\\x9cnot drunk his employer would see\\nto that sir his employer would not allow him to be drunkâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou know his employerâ\\x80\\x9d said i\\n\\nmr wopsle shut his eyes and opened them again performing both\\nceremonies very slowly â\\x80\\x9cyou must have observed gentlemenâ\\x80\\x9d said he\\nâ\\x80\\x9can ignorant and a blatant ass with a rasping throat and a countenance\\nexpressive of low malignity who went throughâ\\x80\\x94i will not say\\nsustainedâ\\x80\\x94the rã´le if i may use a french expression of claudius king\\nof denmark that is his employer gentlemen such is the professionâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nwithout distinctly knowing whether i should have been more sorry for\\nmr wopsle if he had been in despair i was so sorry for him as it was\\nthat i took the opportunity of his turning round to have his braces put\\nonâ\\x80\\x94which jostled us out at the doorwayâ\\x80\\x94to ask herbert what he thought\\nof having him home to supper herbert said he thought it would be kind\\nto do so therefore i invited him and he went to barnardâ\\x80\\x99s with us\\nwrapped up to the eyes and we did our best for him and he sat until\\ntwo oâ\\x80\\x99clock in the morning reviewing his success and developing his\\nplans i forget in detail what they were but i have a general\\nrecollection that he was to begin with reviving the drama and to end\\nwith crushing it inasmuch as his decease would leave it utterly bereft\\nand without a chance or hope\\n\\nmiserably i went to bed after all and miserably thought of estella\\nand miserably dreamed that my expectations were all cancelled and that\\ni had to give my hand in marriage to herbertâ\\x80\\x99s clara or play hamlet to\\nmiss havishamâ\\x80\\x99s ghost before twenty thousand people without knowing\\ntwenty words of it\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter xxxii\\n\\n\\none day when i was busy with my books and mr pocket i received a note\\nby the post the mere outside of which threw me into a great flutter\\nfor though i had never seen the handwriting in which it was addressed\\ni divined whose hand it was it had no set beginning as dear mr pip\\nor dear pip or dear sir or dear anything but ran thusâ\\x80\\x94\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci am to come to london the day after tomorrow by the midday coach i\\nbelieve it was settled you should meet me at all events miss havisham\\nhas that impression and i write in obedience to it she sends you her\\nregard\\n\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyours estellaâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\nif there had been time i should probably have ordered several suits of\\nclothes for this occasion but as there was not i was fain to be\\ncontent with those i had my appetite vanished instantly and i knew no\\npeace or rest until the day arrived not that its arrival brought me\\neither for then i was worse than ever and began haunting the\\ncoachoffice in wood street cheapside before the coach had left the\\nblue boar in our town for all that i knew this perfectly well i still\\nfelt as if it were not safe to let the coachoffice be out of my sight\\nlonger than five minutes at a time and in this condition of unreason i\\nhad performed the first halfhour of a watch of four or five hours\\nwhen wemmick ran against me\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9challoa mr pipâ\\x80\\x9d said he â\\x80\\x9chow do you do i should hardly have\\nthought this was your beatâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni explained that i was waiting to meet somebody who was coming up by\\ncoach and i inquired after the castle and the aged\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cboth flourishing thankyeâ\\x80\\x9d said wemmick â\\x80\\x9cand particularly the aged\\nheâ\\x80\\x99s in wonderful feather heâ\\x80\\x99ll be eightytwo next birthday i have a\\nnotion of firing eightytwo times if the neighbourhood shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t\\ncomplain and that cannon of mine should prove equal to the pressure\\nhowever this is not london talk where do you think i am going toâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cto the officeâ\\x80\\x9d said i for he was tending in that direction\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnext thing to itâ\\x80\\x9d returned wemmick â\\x80\\x9ci am going to newgate we are in\\na bankerâ\\x80\\x99sparcel case just at present and i have been down the road\\ntaking a squint at the scene of action and thereupon must have a word\\nor two with our clientâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cdid your client commit the robberyâ\\x80\\x9d i asked\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbless your soul and body noâ\\x80\\x9d answered wemmick very drily â\\x80\\x9cbut he\\nis accused of it so might you or i be either of us might be accused\\nof it you knowâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9conly neither of us isâ\\x80\\x9d i remarked\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyahâ\\x80\\x9d said wemmick touching me on the breast with his forefinger\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyouâ\\x80\\x99re a deep one mr pip would you like to have a look at newgate\\nhave you time to spareâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni had so much time to spare that the proposal came as a relief\\nnotwithstanding its irreconcilability with my latent desire to keep my\\neye on the coachoffice muttering that i would make the inquiry\\nwhether i had time to walk with him i went into the office and\\nascertained from the clerk with the nicest precision and much to the\\ntrying of his temper the earliest moment at which the coach could be\\nexpectedâ\\x80\\x94which i knew beforehand quite as well as he i then rejoined\\nmr wemmick and affecting to consult my watch and to be surprised by\\nthe information i had received accepted his offer\\n\\nwe were at newgate in a few minutes and we passed through the lodge\\nwhere some fetters were hanging up on the bare walls among the prison\\nrules into the interior of the jail at that time jails were much\\nneglected and the period of exaggerated reaction consequent on all\\npublic wrongdoingâ\\x80\\x94and which is always its heaviest and longest\\npunishmentâ\\x80\\x94was still far off so felons were not lodged and fed better\\nthan soldiers to say nothing of paupers and seldom set fire to their\\nprisons with the excusable object of improving the flavour of their\\nsoup it was visiting time when wemmick took me in and a potman was\\ngoing his rounds with beer and the prisoners behind bars in yards\\nwere buying beer and talking to friends and a frowzy ugly\\ndisorderly depressing scene it was\\n\\nit struck me that wemmick walked among the prisoners much as a gardener\\nmight walk among his plants this was first put into my head by his\\nseeing a shoot that had come up in the night and saying â\\x80\\x9cwhat\\ncaptain tom are you there ah indeedâ\\x80\\x9d and also â\\x80\\x9cis that black\\nbill behind the cistern why i didnâ\\x80\\x99t look for you these two months\\nhow do you find yourselfâ\\x80\\x9d equally in his stopping at the bars and\\nattending to anxious whisperersâ\\x80\\x94always singlyâ\\x80\\x94wemmick with his\\npostoffice in an immovable state looked at them while in conference\\nas if he were taking particular notice of the advance they had made\\nsince last observed towards coming out in full blow at their trial\\n\\nhe was highly popular and i found that he took the familiar department\\nof mr jaggersâ\\x80\\x99s business though something of the state of mr jaggers\\nhung about him too forbidding approach beyond certain limits his\\npersonal recognition of each successive client was comprised in a nod\\nand in his settling his hat a little easier on his head with both\\nhands and then tightening the postoffice and putting his hands in\\nhis pockets in one or two instances there was a difficulty respecting\\nthe raising of fees and then mr wemmick backing as far as possible\\nfrom the insufficient money produced said â\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s no use my boy iâ\\x80\\x99m\\nonly a subordinate i canâ\\x80\\x99t take it donâ\\x80\\x99t go on in that way with a\\nsubordinate if you are unable to make up your quantum my boy you had\\nbetter address yourself to a principal there are plenty of principals\\nin the profession you know and what is not worth the while of one\\nmay be worth the while of another thatâ\\x80\\x99s my recommendation to you\\nspeaking as a subordinate donâ\\x80\\x99t try on useless measures why should\\nyou now whoâ\\x80\\x99s nextâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthus we walked through wemmickâ\\x80\\x99s greenhouse until he turned to me and\\nsaid â\\x80\\x9cnotice the man i shall shake hands withâ\\x80\\x9d i should have done so\\nwithout the preparation as he had shaken hands with no one yet\\n\\nalmost as soon as he had spoken a portly upright man whom i can see\\nnow as i write in a wellworn olivecoloured frockcoat with a\\npeculiar pallor overspreading the red in his complexion and eyes that\\nwent wandering about when he tried to fix them came up to a corner of\\nthe bars and put his hand to his hatâ\\x80\\x94which had a greasy and fatty\\nsurface like cold brothâ\\x80\\x94with a halfserious and halfjocose military\\nsalute\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ccolonel to youâ\\x80\\x9d said wemmick â\\x80\\x9chow are you colonelâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9call right mr wemmickâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ceverything was done that could be done but the evidence was too\\nstrong for us colonelâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyes it was too strong sirâ\\x80\\x94but i donâ\\x80\\x99t careâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cno noâ\\x80\\x9d said wemmick coolly â\\x80\\x9cyou donâ\\x80\\x99t careâ\\x80\\x9d then turning to\\nme â\\x80\\x9cserved his majesty this man was a soldier in the line and bought\\nhis dischargeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni said â\\x80\\x9cindeedâ\\x80\\x9d and the manâ\\x80\\x99s eyes looked at me and then looked over\\nmy head and then looked all round me and then he drew his hand across\\nhis lips and laughed\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci think i shall be out of this on monday sirâ\\x80\\x9d he said to wemmick\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cperhapsâ\\x80\\x9d returned my friend â\\x80\\x9cbut thereâ\\x80\\x99s no knowingâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci am glad to have the chance of bidding you goodbye mr wemmickâ\\x80\\x9d\\nsaid the man stretching out his hand between two bars\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthankyeâ\\x80\\x9d said wemmick shaking hands with him â\\x80\\x9csame to you\\ncolonelâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cif what i had upon me when taken had been real mr wemmickâ\\x80\\x9d said the\\nman unwilling to let his hand go â\\x80\\x9ci should have asked the favour of\\nyour wearing another ringâ\\x80\\x94in acknowledgment of your attentionsâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ciâ\\x80\\x99ll accept the will for the deedâ\\x80\\x9d said wemmick â\\x80\\x9cby the by you were\\nquite a pigeonfancierâ\\x80\\x9d the man looked up at the sky â\\x80\\x9ci am told you\\nhad a remarkable breed of tumblers could you commission any friend\\nof yours to bring me a pair if youâ\\x80\\x99ve no further use for â\\x80\\x99emâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cit shall be done sirâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9call rightâ\\x80\\x9d said wemmick â\\x80\\x9cthey shall be taken care of\\ngoodafternoon colonel goodbyeâ\\x80\\x9d they shook hands again and as we\\nwalked away wemmick said to me â\\x80\\x9ca coiner a very good workman the\\nrecorderâ\\x80\\x99s report is made today and he is sure to be executed on\\nmonday still you see as far as it goes a pair of pigeons are\\nportable property all the sameâ\\x80\\x9d with that he looked back and nodded\\nat this dead plant and then cast his eyes about him in walking out of\\nthe yard as if he were considering what other pot would go best in its\\nplace\\n\\nas we came out of the prison through the lodge i found that the great\\nimportance of my guardian was appreciated by the turnkeys no less than\\nby those whom they held in charge â\\x80\\x9cwell mr wemmickâ\\x80\\x9d said the\\nturnkey who kept us between the two studded and spiked lodge gates\\nand who carefully locked one before he unlocked the other â\\x80\\x9cwhatâ\\x80\\x99s mr\\njaggers going to do with that waterside murder is he going to make it\\nmanslaughter or whatâ\\x80\\x99s he going to make of itâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhy donâ\\x80\\x99t you ask himâ\\x80\\x9d returned wemmick\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9co yes i dare sayâ\\x80\\x9d said the turnkey\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnow thatâ\\x80\\x99s the way with them here mr pipâ\\x80\\x9d remarked wemmick\\nturning to me with his postoffice elongated â\\x80\\x9cthey donâ\\x80\\x99t mind what\\nthey ask of me the subordinate but youâ\\x80\\x99ll never catch â\\x80\\x99em asking any\\nquestions of my principalâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cis this young gentleman one of the â\\x80\\x99prentices or articled ones of your\\nofficeâ\\x80\\x9d asked the turnkey with a grin at mr wemmickâ\\x80\\x99s humour\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthere he goes again you seeâ\\x80\\x9d cried wemmick â\\x80\\x9ci told you so asks\\nanother question of the subordinate before his first is dry well\\nsupposing mr pip is one of themâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhy thenâ\\x80\\x9d said the turnkey grinning again â\\x80\\x9che knows what mr\\njaggers isâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyahâ\\x80\\x9d cried wemmick suddenly hitting out at the turnkey in a\\nfacetious way â\\x80\\x9cyouâ\\x80\\x99re dumb as one of your own keys when you have to do\\nwith my principal you know you are let us out you old fox or iâ\\x80\\x99ll\\nget him to bring an action against you for false imprisonmentâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthe turnkey laughed and gave us good day and stood laughing at us\\nover the spikes of the wicket when we descended the steps into the\\nstreet\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmind you mr pipâ\\x80\\x9d said wemmick gravely in my ear as he took my arm\\nto be more confidential â\\x80\\x9ci donâ\\x80\\x99t know that mr jaggers does a better\\nthing than the way in which he keeps himself so high heâ\\x80\\x99s always so\\nhigh his constant height is of a piece with his immense abilities\\nthat colonel durst no more take leave of him than that turnkey durst\\nask him his intentions respecting a case then between his height and\\nthem he slips in his subordinateâ\\x80\\x94donâ\\x80\\x99t you seeâ\\x80\\x94and so he has â\\x80\\x99em\\nsoul and bodyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni was very much impressed and not for the first time by my guardianâ\\x80\\x99s\\nsubtlety to confess the truth i very heartily wished and not for the\\nfirst time that i had had some other guardian of minor abilities\\n\\nmr wemmick and i parted at the office in little britain where\\nsuppliants for mr jaggersâ\\x80\\x99s notice were lingering about as usual and\\ni returned to my watch in the street of the coachoffice with some\\nthree hours on hand i consumed the whole time in thinking how strange\\nit was that i should be encompassed by all this taint of prison and\\ncrime that in my childhood out on our lonely marshes on a winter\\nevening i should have first encountered it that it should have\\nreappeared on two occasions starting out like a stain that was faded\\nbut not gone that it should in this new way pervade my fortune and\\nadvancement while my mind was thus engaged i thought of the beautiful\\nyoung estella proud and refined coming towards me and i thought with\\nabsolute abhorrence of the contrast between the jail and her i wished\\nthat wemmick had not met me or that i had not yielded to him and gone\\nwith him so that of all days in the year on this day i might not\\nhave had newgate in my breath and on my clothes i beat the prison dust\\noff my feet as i sauntered to and fro and i shook it out of my dress\\nand i exhaled its air from my lungs so contaminated did i feel\\nremembering who was coming that the coach came quickly after all and\\ni was not yet free from the soiling consciousness of mr wemmickâ\\x80\\x99s\\nconservatory when i saw her face at the coach window and her hand\\nwaving to me\\n\\nwhat was the nameless shadow which again in that one instant had\\npassed\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter xxxiii\\n\\n\\nin her furred travellingdress estella seemed more delicately\\nbeautiful than she had ever seemed yet even in my eyes her manner was\\nmore winning than she had cared to let it be to me before and i\\nthought i saw miss havishamâ\\x80\\x99s influence in the change\\n\\nwe stood in the inn yard while she pointed out her luggage to me and\\nwhen it was all collected i rememberedâ\\x80\\x94having forgotten everything but\\nherself in the meanwhileâ\\x80\\x94that i knew nothing of her destination\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci am going to richmondâ\\x80\\x9d she told me â\\x80\\x9cour lesson is that there are\\ntwo richmonds one in surrey and one in yorkshire and that mine is the\\nsurrey richmond the distance is ten miles i am to have a carriage\\nand you are to take me this is my purse and you are to pay my charges\\nout of it o you must take the purse we have no choice you and i\\nbut to obey our instructions we are not free to follow our own\\ndevices you and iâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nas she looked at me in giving me the purse i hoped there was an inner\\nmeaning in her words she said them slightingly but not with\\ndispleasure\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ca carriage will have to be sent for estella will you rest here a\\nlittleâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyes i am to rest here a little and i am to drink some tea and you\\nare to take care of me the whileâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nshe drew her arm through mine as if it must be done and i requested a\\nwaiter who had been staring at the coach like a man who had never seen\\nsuch a thing in his life to show us a private sittingroom upon that\\nhe pulled out a napkin as if it were a magic clue without which he\\ncouldnâ\\x80\\x99t find the way upstairs and led us to the black hole of the\\nestablishment fitted up with a diminishing mirror quite a superfluous\\narticle considering the holeâ\\x80\\x99s proportions an anchovy saucecruet\\nand somebodyâ\\x80\\x99s pattens on my objecting to this retreat he took us\\ninto another room with a dinnertable for thirty and in the grate a\\nscorched leaf of a copybook under a bushel of coaldust having looked\\nat this extinct conflagration and shaken his head he took my order\\nwhich proving to be merely â\\x80\\x9csome tea for the ladyâ\\x80\\x9d sent him out of\\nthe room in a very low state of mind\\n\\ni was and i am sensible that the air of this chamber in its strong\\ncombination of stable with soupstock might have led one to infer that\\nthe coaching department was not doing well and that the enterprising\\nproprietor was boiling down the horses for the refreshment department\\nyet the room was all in all to me estella being in it i thought that\\nwith her i could have been happy there for life i was not at all\\nhappy there at the time observe and i knew it well\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhere are you going to at richmondâ\\x80\\x9d i asked estella\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci am going to liveâ\\x80\\x9d said she â\\x80\\x9cat a great expense with a lady there\\nwho has the powerâ\\x80\\x94or says she hasâ\\x80\\x94of taking me about and introducing\\nme and showing people to me and showing me to peopleâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci suppose you will be glad of variety and admirationâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyes i suppose soâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nshe answered so carelessly that i said â\\x80\\x9cyou speak of yourself as if\\nyou were some one elseâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhere did you learn how i speak of others come comeâ\\x80\\x9d said estella\\nsmiling delightfully â\\x80\\x9cyou must not expect me to go to school to you\\ni must talk in my own way how do you thrive with mr pocketâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci live quite pleasantly there at leastâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d it appeared to me that i was\\nlosing a chance\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cat leastâ\\x80\\x9d repeated estella\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cas pleasantly as i could anywhere away from youâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou silly boyâ\\x80\\x9d said estella quite composedly â\\x80\\x9chow can you talk such\\nnonsense your friend mr matthew i believe is superior to the rest\\nof his familyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cvery superior indeed he is nobodyâ\\x80\\x99s enemyâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cdonâ\\x80\\x99t add but his ownâ\\x80\\x9d interposed estella â\\x80\\x9cfor i hate that class of\\nman but he really is disinterested and above small jealousy and\\nspite i have heardâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci am sure i have every reason to say soâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou have not every reason to say so of the rest of his peopleâ\\x80\\x9d said\\nestella nodding at me with an expression of face that was at once\\ngrave and rallying â\\x80\\x9cfor they beset miss havisham with reports and\\ninsinuations to your disadvantage they watch you misrepresent you\\nwrite letters about you anonymous sometimes and you are the torment\\nand the occupation of their lives you can scarcely realise to yourself\\nthe hatred those people feel for youâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthey do me no harm i hopeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ninstead of answering estella burst out laughing this was very\\nsingular to me and i looked at her in considerable perplexity when\\nshe left offâ\\x80\\x94and she had not laughed languidly but with real\\nenjoymentâ\\x80\\x94i said in my diffident way with herâ\\x80\\x94\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci hope i may suppose that you would not be amused if they did me any\\nharmâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cno no you may be sure of thatâ\\x80\\x9d said estella â\\x80\\x9cyou may be certain\\nthat i laugh because they fail o those people with miss havisham and\\nthe tortures they undergoâ\\x80\\x9d she laughed again and even now when she\\nhad told me why her laughter was very singular to me for i could not\\ndoubt its being genuine and yet it seemed too much for the occasion i\\nthought there must really be something more here than i knew she saw\\nthe thought in my mind and answered it\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cit is not easy for even youâ\\x80\\x9d said estella â\\x80\\x9cto know what satisfaction\\nit gives me to see those people thwarted or what an enjoyable sense of\\nthe ridiculous i have when they are made ridiculous for you were not\\nbrought up in that strange house from a mere baby i was you had not\\nyour little wits sharpened by their intriguing against you suppressed\\nand defenceless under the mask of sympathy and pity and what not that\\nis soft and soothing i had you did not gradually open your round\\nchildish eyes wider and wider to the discovery of that impostor of a\\nwoman who calculates her stores of peace of mind for when she wakes up\\nin the night i didâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nit was no laughing matter with estella now nor was she summoning these\\nremembrances from any shallow place i would not have been the cause of\\nthat look of hers for all my expectations in a heap\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ctwo things i can tell youâ\\x80\\x9d said estella â\\x80\\x9cfirst notwithstanding the\\nproverb that constant dropping will wear away a stone you may set your\\nmind at rest that these people never willâ\\x80\\x94never would in a hundred\\nyearsâ\\x80\\x94impair your ground with miss havisham in any particular great\\nor small second i am beholden to you as the cause of their being so\\nbusy and so mean in vain and there is my hand upon itâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nas she gave it to me playfullyâ\\x80\\x94for her darker mood had been but\\nmomentaryâ\\x80\\x94i held it and put it to my lips â\\x80\\x9cyou ridiculous boyâ\\x80\\x9d said\\nestella â\\x80\\x9cwill you never take warning or do you kiss my hand in the\\nsame spirit in which i once let you kiss my cheekâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhat spirit was thatâ\\x80\\x9d said i\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci must think a moment a spirit of contempt for the fawners and\\nplottersâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cif i say yes may i kiss the cheek againâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou should have asked before you touched the hand but yes if you\\nlikeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni leaned down and her calm face was like a statueâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x9cnowâ\\x80\\x9d said\\nestella gliding away the instant i touched her cheek â\\x80\\x9cyou are to take\\ncare that i have some tea and you are to take me to richmondâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nher reverting to this tone as if our association were forced upon us\\nand we were mere puppets gave me pain but everything in our\\nintercourse did give me pain whatever her tone with me happened to be\\ni could put no trust in it and build no hope on it and yet i went on\\nagainst trust and against hope why repeat it a thousand times so it\\nalways was\\n\\ni rang for the tea and the waiter reappearing with his magic clue\\nbrought in by degrees some fifty adjuncts to that refreshment but of\\ntea not a glimpse a teaboard cups and saucers plates knives and\\nforks including carvers spoons various saltcellars a meek\\nlittle muffin confined with the utmost precaution under a strong iron\\ncover moses in the bulrushes typified by a soft bit of butter in a\\nquantity of parsley a pale loaf with a powdered head two proof\\nimpressions of the bars of the kitchen fireplace on triangular bits of\\nbread and ultimately a fat family urn which the waiter staggered in\\nwith expressing in his countenance burden and suffering after a\\nprolonged absence at this stage of the entertainment he at length came\\nback with a casket of precious appearance containing twigs these i\\nsteeped in hot water and so from the whole of these appliances\\nextracted one cup of i donâ\\x80\\x99t know what for estella\\n\\nthe bill paid and the waiter remembered and the ostler not forgotten\\nand the chambermaid taken into considerationâ\\x80\\x94in a word the whole\\nhouse bribed into a state of contempt and animosity and estellaâ\\x80\\x99s\\npurse much lightenedâ\\x80\\x94we got into our postcoach and drove away\\nturning into cheapside and rattling up newgate street we were soon\\nunder the walls of which i was so ashamed\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhat place is thatâ\\x80\\x9d estella asked me\\n\\ni made a foolish pretence of not at first recognising it and then told\\nher as she looked at it and drew in her head again murmuring\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwretchesâ\\x80\\x9d i would not have confessed to my visit for any\\nconsideration\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmr jaggersâ\\x80\\x9d said i by way of putting it neatly on somebody else\\nâ\\x80\\x9chas the reputation of being more in the secrets of that dismal place\\nthan any man in londonâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9che is more in the secrets of every place i thinkâ\\x80\\x9d said estella in a\\nlow voice\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou have been accustomed to see him often i supposeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci have been accustomed to see him at uncertain intervals ever since i\\ncan remember but i know him no better now than i did before i could\\nspeak plainly what is your own experience of him do you advance with\\nhimâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9conce habituated to his distrustful mannerâ\\x80\\x9d said i â\\x80\\x9ci have done very\\nwellâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9care you intimateâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci have dined with him at his private houseâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci fancyâ\\x80\\x9d said estella shrinking â\\x80\\x9cthat must be a curious placeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cit is a curious placeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni should have been chary of discussing my guardian too freely even with\\nher but i should have gone on with the subject so far as to describe\\nthe dinner in gerrard street if we had not then come into a sudden\\nglare of gas it seemed while it lasted to be all alight and alive\\nwith that inexplicable feeling i had had before and when we were out\\nof it i was as much dazed for a few moments as if i had been in\\nlightning\\n\\nso we fell into other talk and it was principally about the way by\\nwhich we were travelling and about what parts of london lay on this\\nside of it and what on that the great city was almost new to her she\\ntold me for she had never left miss havishamâ\\x80\\x99s neighbourhood until she\\nhad gone to france and she had merely passed through london then in\\ngoing and returning i asked her if my guardian had any charge of her\\nwhile she remained here to that she emphatically said â\\x80\\x9cgod forbidâ\\x80\\x9d\\nand no more\\n\\nit was impossible for me to avoid seeing that she cared to attract me\\nthat she made herself winning and would have won me even if the task\\nhad needed pains yet this made me none the happier for even if she\\nhad not taken that tone of our being disposed of by others i should\\nhave felt that she held my heart in her hand because she wilfully chose\\nto do it and not because it would have wrung any tenderness in her to\\ncrush it and throw it away\\n\\nwhen we passed through hammersmith i showed her where mr matthew\\npocket lived and said it was no great way from richmond and that i\\nhoped i should see her sometimes\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9co yes you are to see me you are to come when you think proper you\\nare to be mentioned to the family indeed you are already mentionedâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni inquired was it a large household she was going to be a member of\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cno there are only two mother and daughter the mother is a lady of\\nsome station though not averse to increasing her incomeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci wonder miss havisham could part with you again so soonâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cit is a part of miss havishamâ\\x80\\x99s plans for me pipâ\\x80\\x9d said estella with\\na sigh as if she were tired â\\x80\\x9ci am to write to her constantly and see\\nher regularly and report how i go onâ\\x80\\x94i and the jewelsâ\\x80\\x94for they are\\nnearly all mine nowâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nit was the first time she had ever called me by my name of course she\\ndid so purposely and knew that i should treasure it up\\n\\nwe came to richmond all too soon and our destination there was a house\\nby the greenâ\\x80\\x94a staid old house where hoops and powder and patches\\nembroidered coats rolled stockings ruffles and swords had had their\\ncourt days many a time some ancient trees before the house were still\\ncut into fashions as formal and unnatural as the hoops and wigs and\\nstiff skirts but their own allotted places in the great procession of\\nthe dead were not far off and they would soon drop into them and go\\nthe silent way of the rest\\n\\na bell with an old voiceâ\\x80\\x94which i dare say in its time had often said to\\nthe house here is the green farthingale here is the diamondhilted\\nsword here are the shoes with red heels and the blue solitaireâ\\x80\\x94sounded\\ngravely in the moonlight and two cherrycoloured maids came fluttering\\nout to receive estella the doorway soon absorbed her boxes and she\\ngave me her hand and a smile and said goodnight and was absorbed\\nlikewise and still i stood looking at the house thinking how happy i\\nshould be if i lived there with her and knowing that i never was happy\\nwith her but always miserable\\n\\ni got into the carriage to be taken back to hammersmith and i got in\\nwith a bad heartache and i got out with a worse heartache at our\\nown door i found little jane pocket coming home from a little party\\nescorted by her little lover and i envied her little lover in spite\\nof his being subject to flopson\\n\\nmr pocket was out lecturing for he was a most delightful lecturer on\\ndomestic economy and his treatises on the management of children and\\nservants were considered the very best textbooks on those themes but\\nmrs pocket was at home and was in a little difficulty on account of\\nthe babyâ\\x80\\x99s having been accommodated with a needlecase to keep him\\nquiet during the unaccountable absence with a relative in the foot\\nguards of millers and more needles were missing than it could be\\nregarded as quite wholesome for a patient of such tender years either\\nto apply externally or to take as a tonic\\n\\nmr pocket being justly celebrated for giving most excellent practical\\nadvice and for having a clear and sound perception of things and a\\nhighly judicious mind i had some notion in my heartache of begging\\nhim to accept my confidence but happening to look up at mrs pocket as\\nshe sat reading her book of dignities after prescribing bed as a\\nsovereign remedy for baby i thoughtâ\\x80\\x94wellâ\\x80\\x94no i wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter xxxiv\\n\\n\\nas i had grown accustomed to my expectations i had insensibly begun to\\nnotice their effect upon myself and those around me their influence on\\nmy own character i disguised from my recognition as much as possible\\nbut i knew very well that it was not all good i lived in a state of\\nchronic uneasiness respecting my behaviour to joe my conscience was\\nnot by any means comfortable about biddy when i woke up in the\\nnightâ\\x80\\x94like camillaâ\\x80\\x94i used to think with a weariness on my spirits\\nthat i should have been happier and better if i had never seen miss\\nhavishamâ\\x80\\x99s face and had risen to manhood content to be partners with\\njoe in the honest old forge many a time of an evening when i sat\\nalone looking at the fire i thought after all there was no fire like\\nthe forge fire and the kitchen fire at home\\n\\nyet estella was so inseparable from all my restlessness and disquiet of\\nmind that i really fell into confusion as to the limits of my own part\\nin its production that is to say supposing i had had no expectations\\nand yet had had estella to think of i could not make out to my\\nsatisfaction that i should have done much better now concerning the\\ninfluence of my position on others i was in no such difficulty and so\\ni perceivedâ\\x80\\x94though dimly enough perhapsâ\\x80\\x94that it was not beneficial to\\nanybody and above all that it was not beneficial to herbert my\\nlavish habits led his easy nature into expenses that he could not\\nafford corrupted the simplicity of his life and disturbed his peace\\nwith anxieties and regrets i was not at all remorseful for having\\nunwittingly set those other branches of the pocket family to the poor\\narts they practised because such littlenesses were their natural bent\\nand would have been evoked by anybody else if i had left them\\nslumbering but herbertâ\\x80\\x99s was a very different case and it often\\ncaused me a twinge to think that i had done him evil service in\\ncrowding his sparely furnished chambers with incongruous upholstery\\nwork and placing the canarybreasted avenger at his disposal\\n\\nso now as an infallible way of making little ease great ease i began\\nto contract a quantity of debt i could hardly begin but herbert must\\nbegin too so he soon followed at startopâ\\x80\\x99s suggestion we put\\nourselves down for election into a club called the finches of the\\ngrove the object of which institution i have never divined if it were\\nnot that the members should dine expensively once a fortnight to\\nquarrel among themselves as much as possible after dinner and to cause\\nsix waiters to get drunk on the stairs i know that these gratifying\\nsocial ends were so invariably accomplished that herbert and i\\nunderstood nothing else to be referred to in the first standing toast\\nof the society which ran â\\x80\\x9cgentlemen may the present promotion of good\\nfeeling ever reign predominant among the finches of the groveâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthe finches spent their money foolishly the hotel we dined at was in\\ncovent garden and the first finch i saw when i had the honour of\\njoining the grove was bentley drummle at that time floundering about\\ntown in a cab of his own and doing a great deal of damage to the posts\\nat the street corners occasionally he shot himself out of his\\nequipage headforemost over the apron and i saw him on one occasion\\ndeliver himself at the door of the grove in this unintentional wayâ\\x80\\x94like\\ncoals but here i anticipate a little for i was not a finch and could\\nnot be according to the sacred laws of the society until i came of\\nage\\n\\nin my confidence in my own resources i would willingly have taken\\nherbertâ\\x80\\x99s expenses on myself but herbert was proud and i could make\\nno such proposal to him so he got into difficulties in every\\ndirection and continued to look about him when we gradually fell into\\nkeeping late hours and late company i noticed that he looked about him\\nwith a desponding eye at breakfasttime that he began to look about\\nhim more hopefully about midday that he drooped when he came into\\ndinner that he seemed to descry capital in the distance rather\\nclearly after dinner that he all but realised capital towards\\nmidnight and that at about two oâ\\x80\\x99clock in the morning he became so\\ndeeply despondent again as to talk of buying a rifle and going to\\namerica with a general purpose of compelling buffaloes to make his\\nfortune\\n\\ni was usually at hammersmith about half the week and when i was at\\nhammersmith i haunted richmond whereof separately by and by herbert\\nwould often come to hammersmith when i was there and i think at those\\nseasons his father would occasionally have some passing perception that\\nthe opening he was looking for had not appeared yet but in the\\ngeneral tumbling up of the family his tumbling out in life somewhere\\nwas a thing to transact itself somehow in the meantime mr pocket grew\\ngreyer and tried oftener to lift himself out of his perplexities by\\nthe hair while mrs pocket tripped up the family with her footstool\\nread her book of dignities lost her pockethandkerchief told us about\\nher grandpapa and taught the young idea how to shoot by shooting it\\ninto bed whenever it attracted her notice\\n\\nas i am now generalising a period of my life with the object of\\nclearing my way before me i can scarcely do so better than by at once\\ncompleting the description of our usual manners and customs at\\nbarnardâ\\x80\\x99s inn\\n\\nwe spent as much money as we could and got as little for it as people\\ncould make up their minds to give us we were always more or less\\nmiserable and most of our acquaintance were in the same condition\\nthere was a gay fiction among us that we were constantly enjoying\\nourselves and a skeleton truth that we never did to the best of my\\nbelief our case was in the last aspect a rather common one\\n\\nevery morning with an air ever new herbert went into the city to look\\nabout him i often paid him a visit in the dark backroom in which he\\nconsorted with an inkjar a hatpeg a coalbox a stringbox an\\nalmanac a desk and stool and a ruler and i do not remember that i\\never saw him do anything else but look about him if we all did what we\\nundertake to do as faithfully as herbert did we might live in a\\nrepublic of the virtues he had nothing else to do poor fellow except\\nat a certain hour of every afternoon to â\\x80\\x9cgo to lloydâ\\x80\\x99sâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94in observance\\nof a ceremony of seeing his principal i think he never did anything\\nelse in connection with lloydâ\\x80\\x99s that i could find out except come back\\nagain when he felt his case unusually serious and that he positively\\nmust find an opening he would go on â\\x80\\x99change at a busy time and walk\\nin and out in a kind of gloomy country dance figure among the\\nassembled magnates â\\x80\\x9cforâ\\x80\\x9d says herbert to me coming home to dinner on\\none of those special occasions â\\x80\\x9ci find the truth to be handel that\\nan opening wonâ\\x80\\x99t come to one but one must go to itâ\\x80\\x94so i have beenâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nif we had been less attached to one another i think we must have hated\\none another regularly every morning i detested the chambers beyond\\nexpression at that period of repentance and could not endure the sight\\nof the avengerâ\\x80\\x99s livery which had a more expensive and a less\\nremunerative appearance then than at any other time in the\\nfourandtwenty hours as we got more and more into debt breakfast\\nbecame a hollower and hollower form and being on one occasion at\\nbreakfasttime threatened by letter with legal proceedings â\\x80\\x9cnot\\nunwholly unconnectedâ\\x80\\x9d as my local paper might put it â\\x80\\x9cwith jeweleryâ\\x80\\x9d\\ni went so far as to seize the avenger by his blue collar and shake him\\noff his feetâ\\x80\\x94so that he was actually in the air like a booted\\ncupidâ\\x80\\x94for presuming to suppose that we wanted a roll\\n\\nat certain timesâ\\x80\\x94meaning at uncertain times for they depended on our\\nhumourâ\\x80\\x94i would say to herbert as if it were a remarkable discoveryâ\\x80\\x94\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmy dear herbert we are getting on badlyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmy dear handelâ\\x80\\x9d herbert would say to me in all sincerity â\\x80\\x9cif you\\nwill believe me those very words were on my lips by a strange\\ncoincidenceâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthen herbertâ\\x80\\x9d i would respond â\\x80\\x9clet us look into our affairsâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nwe always derived profound satisfaction from making an appointment for\\nthis purpose i always thought this was business this was the way to\\nconfront the thing this was the way to take the foe by the throat and\\ni know herbert thought so too\\n\\nwe ordered something rather special for dinner with a bottle of\\nsomething similarly out of the common way in order that our minds\\nmight be fortified for the occasion and we might come well up to the\\nmark dinner over we produced a bundle of pens a copious supply of\\nink and a goodly show of writing and blotting paper for there was\\nsomething very comfortable in having plenty of stationery\\n\\ni would then take a sheet of paper and write across the top of it in\\na neat hand the heading â\\x80\\x9cmemorandum of pipâ\\x80\\x99s debtsâ\\x80\\x9d with barnardâ\\x80\\x99s\\ninn and the date very carefully added herbert would also take a sheet\\nof paper and write across it with similar formalities â\\x80\\x9cmemorandum of\\nherbertâ\\x80\\x99s debtsâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\neach of us would then refer to a confused heap of papers at his side\\nwhich had been thrown into drawers worn into holes in pockets half\\nburnt in lighting candles stuck for weeks into the lookingglass and\\notherwise damaged the sound of our pens going refreshed us\\nexceedingly insomuch that i sometimes found it difficult to\\ndistinguish between this edifying business proceeding and actually\\npaying the money in point of meritorious character the two things\\nseemed about equal\\n\\nwhen we had written a little while i would ask herbert how he got on\\nherbert probably would have been scratching his head in a most rueful\\nmanner at the sight of his accumulating figures\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthey are mounting up handelâ\\x80\\x9d herbert would say â\\x80\\x9cupon my life they\\nare mounting upâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbe firm herbertâ\\x80\\x9d i would retort plying my own pen with great\\nassiduity â\\x80\\x9clook the thing in the face look into your affairs stare\\nthem out of countenanceâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cso i would handel only they are staring me out of countenanceâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nhowever my determined manner would have its effect and herbert would\\nfall to work again after a time he would give up once more on the\\nplea that he had not got cobbsâ\\x80\\x99s bill or lobbsâ\\x80\\x99s or nobbsâ\\x80\\x99s as the\\ncase might be\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthen herbert estimate estimate it in round numbers and put it\\ndownâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhat a fellow of resource you areâ\\x80\\x9d my friend would reply with\\nadmiration â\\x80\\x9creally your business powers are very remarkableâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni thought so too i established with myself on these occasions the\\nreputation of a firstrate man of businessâ\\x80\\x94prompt decisive\\nenergetic clear coolheaded when i had got all my responsibilities\\ndown upon my list i compared each with the bill and ticked it off my\\nselfapproval when i ticked an entry was quite a luxurious sensation\\nwhen i had no more ticks to make i folded all my bills up uniformly\\ndocketed each on the back and tied the whole into a symmetrical\\nbundle then i did the same for herbert who modestly said he had not\\nmy administrative genius and felt that i had brought his affairs into\\na focus for him\\n\\nmy business habits had one other bright feature which i called\\nâ\\x80\\x9cleaving a marginâ\\x80\\x9d for example supposing herbertâ\\x80\\x99s debts to be one\\nhundred and sixtyfour pounds fourandtwopence i would say â\\x80\\x9cleave a\\nmargin and put them down at two hundredâ\\x80\\x9d or supposing my own to be\\nfour times as much i would leave a margin and put them down at seven\\nhundred i had the highest opinion of the wisdom of this same margin\\nbut i am bound to acknowledge that on looking back i deem it to have\\nbeen an expensive device for we always ran into new debt immediately\\nto the full extent of the margin and sometimes in the sense of\\nfreedom and solvency it imparted got pretty far on into another\\nmargin\\n\\nbut there was a calm a rest a virtuous hush consequent on these\\nexaminations of our affairs that gave me for the time an admirable\\nopinion of myself soothed by my exertions my method and herbertâ\\x80\\x99s\\ncompliments i would sit with his symmetrical bundle and my own on the\\ntable before me among the stationery and feel like a bank of some\\nsort rather than a private individual\\n\\nwe shut our outer door on these solemn occasions in order that we\\nmight not be interrupted i had fallen into my serene state one\\nevening when we heard a letter dropped through the slit in the said\\ndoor and fall on the ground â\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s for you handelâ\\x80\\x9d said herbert\\ngoing out and coming back with it â\\x80\\x9cand i hope there is nothing the\\nmatterâ\\x80\\x9d this was in allusion to its heavy black seal and border\\n\\nthe letter was signed trabb  co and its contents were simply that i\\nwas an honoured sir and that they begged to inform me that mrs j\\ngargery had departed this life on monday last at twenty minutes past\\nsix in the evening and that my attendance was requested at the\\ninterment on monday next at three oâ\\x80\\x99clock in the afternoon\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter xxxv\\n\\n\\nit was the first time that a grave had opened in my road of life and\\nthe gap it made in the smooth ground was wonderful the figure of my\\nsister in her chair by the kitchen fire haunted me night and day that\\nthe place could possibly be without her was something my mind seemed\\nunable to compass and whereas she had seldom or never been in my\\nthoughts of late i had now the strangest ideas that she was coming\\ntowards me in the street or that she would presently knock at the\\ndoor in my rooms too with which she had never been at all associated\\nthere was at once the blankness of death and a perpetual suggestion of\\nthe sound of her voice or the turn of her face or figure as if she\\nwere still alive and had been often there\\n\\nwhatever my fortunes might have been i could scarcely have recalled my\\nsister with much tenderness but i suppose there is a shock of regret\\nwhich may exist without much tenderness under its influence and\\nperhaps to make up for the want of the softer feeling i was seized\\nwith a violent indignation against the assailant from whom she had\\nsuffered so much and i felt that on sufficient proof i could have\\nrevengefully pursued orlick or any one else to the last extremity\\n\\nhaving written to joe to offer him consolation and to assure him that\\ni would come to the funeral i passed the intermediate days in the\\ncurious state of mind i have glanced at i went down early in the\\nmorning and alighted at the blue boar in good time to walk over to the\\nforge\\n\\nit was fine summer weather again and as i walked along the times\\nwhen i was a little helpless creature and my sister did not spare me\\nvividly returned but they returned with a gentle tone upon them that\\nsoftened even the edge of tickler for now the very breath of the\\nbeans and clover whispered to my heart that the day must come when it\\nwould be well for my memory that others walking in the sunshine should\\nbe softened as they thought of me\\n\\nat last i came within sight of the house and saw that trabb and co\\nhad put in a funereal execution and taken possession two dismally\\nabsurd persons each ostentatiously exhibiting a crutch done up in a\\nblack bandageâ\\x80\\x94as if that instrument could possibly communicate any\\ncomfort to anybodyâ\\x80\\x94were posted at the front door and in one of them i\\nrecognised a postboy discharged from the boar for turning a young\\ncouple into a sawpit on their bridal morning in consequence of\\nintoxication rendering it necessary for him to ride his horse clasped\\nround the neck with both arms all the children of the village and\\nmost of the women were admiring these sable warders and the closed\\nwindows of the house and forge and as i came up one of the two\\nwarders the postboy knocked at the doorâ\\x80\\x94implying that i was far too\\nmuch exhausted by grief to have strength remaining to knock for myself\\n\\nanother sable warder a carpenter who had once eaten two geese for a\\nwager opened the door and showed me into the best parlour here mr\\ntrabb had taken unto himself the best table and had got all the leaves\\nup and was holding a kind of black bazaar with the aid of a quantity\\nof black pins at the moment of my arrival he had just finished\\nputting somebodyâ\\x80\\x99s hat into black longclothes like an african baby\\nso he held out his hand for mine but i misled by the action and\\nconfused by the occasion shook hands with him with every testimony of\\nwarm affection\\n\\npoor dear joe entangled in a little black cloak tied in a large bow\\nunder his chin was seated apart at the upper end of the room where\\nas chief mourner he had evidently been stationed by trabb when i bent\\ndown and said to him â\\x80\\x9cdear joe how are youâ\\x80\\x9d he said â\\x80\\x9cpip old chap\\nyou knowed her when she were a fine figure of aâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d and clasped my hand\\nand said no more\\n\\nbiddy looking very neat and modest in her black dress went quietly\\nhere and there and was very helpful when i had spoken to biddy as i\\nthought it not a time for talking i went and sat down near joe and\\nthere began to wonder in what part of the house itâ\\x80\\x94sheâ\\x80\\x94my sisterâ\\x80\\x94was\\nthe air of the parlour being faint with the smell of sweetcake i\\nlooked about for the table of refreshments it was scarcely visible\\nuntil one had got accustomed to the gloom but there was a cutup plum\\ncake upon it and there were cutup oranges and sandwiches and\\nbiscuits and two decanters that i knew very well as ornaments but had\\nnever seen used in all my life one full of port and one of sherry\\nstanding at this table i became conscious of the servile pumblechook\\nin a black cloak and several yards of hatband who was alternately\\nstuffing himself and making obsequious movements to catch my\\nattention the moment he succeeded he came over to me breathing\\nsherry and crumbs and said in a subdued voice â\\x80\\x9cmay i dear sirâ\\x80\\x9d and\\ndid i then descried mr and mrs hubble the lastnamed in a decent\\nspeechless paroxysm in a corner we were all going to â\\x80\\x9cfollowâ\\x80\\x9d and\\nwere all in course of being tied up separately by trabb into\\nridiculous bundles\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhich i meantersay pipâ\\x80\\x9d joe whispered me as we were being what mr\\ntrabb called â\\x80\\x9cformedâ\\x80\\x9d in the parlour two and twoâ\\x80\\x94and it was\\ndreadfully like a preparation for some grim kind of dance â\\x80\\x9cwhich i\\nmeantersay sir as i would in preference have carried her to the\\nchurch myself along with three or four friendly ones wot come to it\\nwith willing harts and arms but it were considered wot the neighbours\\nwould look down on such and would be of opinions as it were wanting in\\nrespectâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cpockethandkerchiefs out allâ\\x80\\x9d cried mr trabb at this point in a\\ndepressed businesslike voice â\\x80\\x9cpockethandkerchiefs out we are\\nreadyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nso we all put our pockethandkerchiefs to our faces as if our noses\\nwere bleeding and filed out two and two joe and i biddy and\\npumblechook mr and mrs hubble the remains of my poor sister had\\nbeen brought round by the kitchen door and it being a point of\\nundertaking ceremony that the six bearers must be stifled and blinded\\nunder a horrible black velvet housing with a white border the whole\\nlooked like a blind monster with twelve human legs shuffling and\\nblundering along under the guidance of two keepersâ\\x80\\x94the postboy and\\nhis comrade\\n\\nthe neighbourhood however highly approved of these arrangements and\\nwe were much admired as we went through the village the more youthful\\nand vigorous part of the community making dashes now and then to cut us\\noff and lying in wait to intercept us at points of vantage at such\\ntimes the more exuberant among them called out in an excited manner on\\nour emergence round some corner of expectancy â\\x80\\x9chere they comeâ\\x80\\x9d\\nâ\\x80\\x9chere they areâ\\x80\\x9d and we were all but cheered in this progress i was\\nmuch annoyed by the abject pumblechook who being behind me persisted\\nall the way as a delicate attention in arranging my streaming hatband\\nand smoothing my cloak my thoughts were further distracted by the\\nexcessive pride of mr and mrs hubble who were surpassingly conceited\\nand vainglorious in being members of so distinguished a procession\\n\\nand now the range of marshes lay clear before us with the sails of the\\nships on the river growing out of it and we went into the churchyard\\nclose to the graves of my unknown parents philip pirrip late of this\\nparish and also georgiana wife of the above and there my sister was\\nlaid quietly in the earth while the larks sang high above it and the\\nlight wind strewed it with beautiful shadows of clouds and trees\\n\\nof the conduct of the worldly minded pumblechook while this was doing\\ni desire to say no more than it was all addressed to me and that even\\nwhen those noble passages were read which remind humanity how it\\nbrought nothing into the world and can take nothing out and how it\\nfleeth like a shadow and never continueth long in one stay i heard him\\ncough a reservation of the case of a young gentleman who came\\nunexpectedly into large property when we got back he had the\\nhardihood to tell me that he wished my sister could have known i had\\ndone her so much honour and to hint that she would have considered it\\nreasonably purchased at the price of her death after that he drank\\nall the rest of the sherry and mr hubble drank the port and the two\\ntalked which i have since observed to be customary in such cases as\\nif they were of quite another race from the deceased and were\\nnotoriously immortal finally he went away with mr and mrs\\nhubbleâ\\x80\\x94to make an evening of it i felt sure and to tell the jolly\\nbargemen that he was the founder of my fortunes and my earliest\\nbenefactor\\n\\nwhen they were all gone and when trabb and his menâ\\x80\\x94but not his boy i\\nlooked for himâ\\x80\\x94had crammed their mummery into bags and were gone too\\nthe house felt wholesomer soon afterwards biddy joe and i had a\\ncold dinner together but we dined in the best parlour not in the old\\nkitchen and joe was so exceedingly particular what he did with his\\nknife and fork and the saltcellar and what not that there was great\\nrestraint upon us but after dinner when i made him take his pipe and\\nwhen i had loitered with him about the forge and when we sat down\\ntogether on the great block of stone outside it we got on better i\\nnoticed that after the funeral joe changed his clothes so far as to\\nmake a compromise between his sunday dress and working dress in which\\nthe dear fellow looked natural and like the man he was\\n\\nhe was very much pleased by my asking if i might sleep in my own little\\nroom and i was pleased too for i felt that i had done rather a great\\nthing in making the request when the shadows of evening were closing\\nin i took an opportunity of getting into the garden with biddy for a\\nlittle talk\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbiddyâ\\x80\\x9d said i â\\x80\\x9ci think you might have written to me about these sad\\nmattersâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cdo you mr pipâ\\x80\\x9d said biddy â\\x80\\x9ci should have written if i had thought\\nthatâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cdonâ\\x80\\x99t suppose that i mean to be unkind biddy when i say i consider\\nthat you ought to have thought thatâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cdo you mr pipâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nshe was so quiet and had such an orderly good and pretty way with\\nher that i did not like the thought of making her cry again after\\nlooking a little at her downcast eyes as she walked beside me i gave\\nup that point\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci suppose it will be difficult for you to remain here now biddy\\ndearâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9coh i canâ\\x80\\x99t do so mr pipâ\\x80\\x9d said biddy in a tone of regret but still\\nof quiet conviction â\\x80\\x9ci have been speaking to mrs hubble and i am\\ngoing to her tomorrow i hope we shall be able to take some care of\\nmr gargery together until he settles downâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9chow are you going to live biddy if you want any moâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9chow am i going to liveâ\\x80\\x9d repeated biddy striking in with a momentary\\nflush upon her face â\\x80\\x9ciâ\\x80\\x99ll tell you mr pip i am going to try to get\\nthe place of mistress in the new school nearly finished here i can be\\nwell recommended by all the neighbours and i hope i can be industrious\\nand patient and teach myself while i teach others you know mr pipâ\\x80\\x9d\\npursued biddy with a smile as she raised her eyes to my face â\\x80\\x9cthe\\nnew schools are not like the old but i learnt a good deal from you\\nafter that time and have had time since then to improveâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci think you would always improve biddy under any circumstancesâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cah except in my bad side of human natureâ\\x80\\x9d murmured biddy\\n\\nit was not so much a reproach as an irresistible thinking aloud well\\ni thought i would give up that point too so i walked a little further\\nwith biddy looking silently at her downcast eyes\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci have not heard the particulars of my sisterâ\\x80\\x99s death biddyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthey are very slight poor thing she had been in one of her bad\\nstatesâ\\x80\\x94though they had got better of late rather than worseâ\\x80\\x94for four\\ndays when she came out of it in the evening just at teatime and\\nsaid quite plainly â\\x80\\x98joeâ\\x80\\x99 as she had never said any word for a long\\nwhile i ran and fetched in mr gargery from the forge she made signs\\nto me that she wanted him to sit down close to her and wanted me to\\nput her arms round his neck so i put them round his neck and she laid\\nher head down on his shoulder quite content and satisfied and so she\\npresently said â\\x80\\x98joeâ\\x80\\x99 again and once â\\x80\\x98pardonâ\\x80\\x99 and once â\\x80\\x98pipâ\\x80\\x99 and so\\nshe never lifted her head up any more and it was just an hour later\\nwhen we laid it down on her own bed because we found she was goneâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nbiddy cried the darkening garden and the lane and the stars that\\nwere coming out were blurred in my own sight\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnothing was ever discovered biddyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnothingâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cdo you know what is become of orlickâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci should think from the colour of his clothes that he is working in\\nthe quarriesâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cof course you have seen him thenâ\\x80\\x94why are you looking at that dark\\ntree in the laneâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci saw him there on the night she diedâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthat was not the last time either biddyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cno i have seen him there since we have been walking hereâ\\x80\\x94it is of\\nno useâ\\x80\\x9d said biddy laying her hand upon my arm as i was for running\\nout â\\x80\\x9cyou know i would not deceive you he was not there a minute and\\nhe is goneâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nit revived my utmost indignation to find that she was still pursued by\\nthis fellow and i felt inveterate against him i told her so and told\\nher that i would spend any money or take any pains to drive him out of\\nthat country by degrees she led me into more temperate talk and she\\ntold me how joe loved me and how joe never complained of anythingâ\\x80\\x94she\\ndidnâ\\x80\\x99t say of me she had no need i knew what she meantâ\\x80\\x94but ever did\\nhis duty in his way of life with a strong hand a quiet tongue and a\\ngentle heart\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cindeed it would be hard to say too much for himâ\\x80\\x9d said i â\\x80\\x9cand biddy\\nwe must often speak of these things for of course i shall be often\\ndown here now i am not going to leave poor joe aloneâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nbiddy said never a single word\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbiddy donâ\\x80\\x99t you hear meâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyes mr pipâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnot to mention your calling me mr pipâ\\x80\\x94which appears to me to be in\\nbad taste biddyâ\\x80\\x94what do you meanâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhat do i meanâ\\x80\\x9d asked biddy timidly\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbiddyâ\\x80\\x9d said i in a virtuously selfasserting manner â\\x80\\x9ci must request\\nto know what you mean by thisâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cby thisâ\\x80\\x9d said biddy\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnow donâ\\x80\\x99t echoâ\\x80\\x9d i retorted â\\x80\\x9cyou used not to echo biddyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cused notâ\\x80\\x9d said biddy â\\x80\\x9co mr pip usedâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nwell i rather thought i would give up that point too after another\\nsilent turn in the garden i fell back on the main position\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbiddyâ\\x80\\x9d said i â\\x80\\x9ci made a remark respecting my coming down here often\\nto see joe which you received with a marked silence have the\\ngoodness biddy to tell me whyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9care you quite sure then that you will come to see him oftenâ\\x80\\x9d asked\\nbiddy stopping in the narrow garden walk and looking at me under the\\nstars with a clear and honest eye\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9co dear meâ\\x80\\x9d said i as if i found myself compelled to give up biddy in\\ndespair â\\x80\\x9cthis really is a very bad side of human nature donâ\\x80\\x99t say any\\nmore if you please biddy this shocks me very muchâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nfor which cogent reason i kept biddy at a distance during supper and\\nwhen i went up to my own old little room took as stately a leave of\\nher as i could in my murmuring soul deem reconcilable with the\\nchurchyard and the event of the day as often as i was restless in the\\nnight and that was every quarter of an hour i reflected what an\\nunkindness what an injury what an injustice biddy had done me\\n\\nearly in the morning i was to go early in the morning i was out and\\nlooking in unseen at one of the wooden windows of the forge there i\\nstood for minutes looking at joe already at work with a glow of\\nhealth and strength upon his face that made it show as if the bright\\nsun of the life in store for him were shining on it\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cgoodbye dear joeâ\\x80\\x94no donâ\\x80\\x99t wipe it offâ\\x80\\x94for godâ\\x80\\x99s sake give me your\\nblackened handâ\\x80\\x94i shall be down soon and oftenâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nillustration\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnever too soon sirâ\\x80\\x9d said joe â\\x80\\x9cand never too often pipâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nbiddy was waiting for me at the kitchen door with a mug of new milk\\nand a crust of bread â\\x80\\x9cbiddyâ\\x80\\x9d said i when i gave her my hand at\\nparting â\\x80\\x9ci am not angry but i am hurtâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cno donâ\\x80\\x99t be hurtâ\\x80\\x9d she pleaded quite pathetically â\\x80\\x9clet only me be\\nhurt if i have been ungenerousâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nonce more the mists were rising as i walked away if they disclosed to\\nme as i suspect they did that i should not come back and that\\nbiddy was quite right all i can say isâ\\x80\\x94they were quite right too\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter xxxvi\\n\\n\\nherbert and i went on from bad to worse in the way of increasing our\\ndebts looking into our affairs leaving margins and the like\\nexemplary transactions and time went on whether or no as he has a\\nway of doing and i came of ageâ\\x80\\x94in fulfilment of herbertâ\\x80\\x99s prediction\\nthat i should do so before i knew where i was\\n\\nherbert himself had come of age eight months before me as he had\\nnothing else than his majority to come into the event did not make a\\nprofound sensation in barnardâ\\x80\\x99s inn but we had looked forward to my\\noneandtwentieth birthday with a crowd of speculations and\\nanticipations for we had both considered that my guardian could hardly\\nhelp saying something definite on that occasion\\n\\ni had taken care to have it well understood in little britain when my\\nbirthday was on the day before it i received an official note from\\nwemmick informing me that mr jaggers would be glad if i would call\\nupon him at five in the afternoon of the auspicious day this convinced\\nus that something great was to happen and threw me into an unusual\\nflutter when i repaired to my guardianâ\\x80\\x99s office a model of\\npunctuality\\n\\nin the outer office wemmick offered me his congratulations and\\nincidentally rubbed the side of his nose with a folded piece of\\ntissuepaper that i liked the look of but he said nothing respecting\\nit and motioned me with a nod into my guardianâ\\x80\\x99s room it was\\nnovember and my guardian was standing before his fire leaning his back\\nagainst the chimneypiece with his hands under his coattails\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwell pipâ\\x80\\x9d said he â\\x80\\x9ci must call you mr pip today congratulations\\nmr pipâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nwe shook handsâ\\x80\\x94he was always a remarkably short shakerâ\\x80\\x94and i thanked\\nhim\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ctake a chair mr pipâ\\x80\\x9d said my guardian\\n\\nas i sat down and he preserved his attitude and bent his brows at his\\nboots i felt at a disadvantage which reminded me of that old time\\nwhen i had been put upon a tombstone the two ghastly casts on the\\nshelf were not far from him and their expression was as if they were\\nmaking a stupid apoplectic attempt to attend to the conversation\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnow my young friendâ\\x80\\x9d my guardian began as if i were a witness in the\\nbox â\\x80\\x9ci am going to have a word or two with youâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cif you please sirâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhat do you supposeâ\\x80\\x9d said mr jaggers bending forward to look at the\\nground and then throwing his head back to look at the ceilingâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cwhat\\ndo you suppose you are living at the rate ofâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cat the rate of sirâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9catâ\\x80\\x9d repeated mr jaggers still looking at the ceiling\\nâ\\x80\\x9ctheâ\\x80\\x94rateâ\\x80\\x94ofâ\\x80\\x9d and then looked all round the room and paused with his\\npockethandkerchief in his hand halfway to his nose\\n\\ni had looked into my affairs so often that i had thoroughly destroyed\\nany slight notion i might ever have had of their bearings reluctantly\\ni confessed myself quite unable to answer the question this reply\\nseemed agreeable to mr jaggers who said â\\x80\\x9ci thought soâ\\x80\\x9d and blew his\\nnose with an air of satisfaction\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnow i have asked you a question my friendâ\\x80\\x9d said mr jaggers\\nâ\\x80\\x9chave you anything to ask meâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cof course it would be a great relief to me to ask you several\\nquestions sir but i remember your prohibitionâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cask oneâ\\x80\\x9d said mr jaggers\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cis my benefactor to be made known to me todayâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cno ask anotherâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cis that confidence to be imparted to me soonâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwaive that a momentâ\\x80\\x9d said mr jaggers â\\x80\\x9cand ask anotherâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni looked about me but there appeared to be now no possible escape from\\nthe inquiry â\\x80\\x9chaveiâ\\x80\\x94anything to receive sirâ\\x80\\x9d on that mr jaggers\\nsaid triumphantly â\\x80\\x9ci thought we should come to itâ\\x80\\x9d and called to\\nwemmick to give him that piece of paper wemmick appeared handed it\\nin and disappeared\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnow mr pipâ\\x80\\x9d said mr jaggers â\\x80\\x9cattend if you please you have been\\ndrawing pretty freely here your name occurs pretty often in wemmickâ\\x80\\x99s\\ncashbook but you are in debt of courseâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci am afraid i must say yes sirâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou know you must say yes donâ\\x80\\x99t youâ\\x80\\x9d said mr jaggers\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyes sirâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci donâ\\x80\\x99t ask you what you owe because you donâ\\x80\\x99t know and if you did\\nknow you wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t tell me you would say less yes yes my friendâ\\x80\\x9d\\ncried mr jaggers waving his forefinger to stop me as i made a show of\\nprotesting â\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s likely enough that you think you wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t but you\\nwould youâ\\x80\\x99ll excuse me but i know better than you now take this\\npiece of paper in your hand you have got it very good now unfold it\\nand tell me what it isâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthis is a banknoteâ\\x80\\x9d said i â\\x80\\x9cfor five hundred poundsâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthat is a banknoteâ\\x80\\x9d repeated mr jaggers â\\x80\\x9cfor five hundred pounds\\nand a very handsome sum of money too i think you consider it soâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9chow could i do otherwiseâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cah but answer the questionâ\\x80\\x9d said mr jaggers\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cundoubtedlyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou consider it undoubtedly a handsome sum of money now that\\nhandsome sum of money pip is your own it is a present to you on this\\nday in earnest of your expectations and at the rate of that handsome\\nsum of money per annum and at no higher rate you are to live until\\nthe donor of the whole appears that is to say you will now take your\\nmoney affairs entirely into your own hands and you will draw from\\nwemmick one hundred and twentyfive pounds per quarter until you are\\nin communication with the fountainhead and no longer with the mere\\nagent as i have told you before i am the mere agent i execute my\\ninstructions and i am paid for doing so i think them injudicious but\\ni am not paid for giving any opinion on their meritsâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni was beginning to express my gratitude to my benefactor for the great\\nliberality with which i was treated when mr jaggers stopped me â\\x80\\x9ci am\\nnot paid pipâ\\x80\\x9d said he coolly â\\x80\\x9cto carry your words to any oneâ\\x80\\x9d and\\nthen gathered up his coattails as he had gathered up the subject and\\nstood frowning at his boots as if he suspected them of designs against\\nhim\\n\\nafter a pause i hintedâ\\x80\\x94\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthere was a question just now mr jaggers which you desired me to\\nwaive for a moment i hope i am doing nothing wrong in asking it\\nagainâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhat is itâ\\x80\\x9d said he\\n\\ni might have known that he would never help me out but it took me\\naback to have to shape the question afresh as if it were quite new\\nâ\\x80\\x9cis it likelyâ\\x80\\x9d i said after hesitating â\\x80\\x9cthat my patron the\\nfountainhead you have spoken of mr jaggers will soonâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d there i\\ndelicately stopped\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwill soon whatâ\\x80\\x9d asked mr jaggers â\\x80\\x9cthatâ\\x80\\x99s no question as it stands\\nyou knowâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwill soon come to londonâ\\x80\\x9d said i after casting about for a precise\\nform of words â\\x80\\x9cor summon me anywhere elseâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnow hereâ\\x80\\x9d replied mr jaggers fixing me for the first time with his\\ndark deepset eyes â\\x80\\x9cwe must revert to the evening when we first\\nencountered one another in your village what did i tell you then\\npipâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou told me mr jaggers that it might be years hence when that\\nperson appearedâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cjust soâ\\x80\\x9d said mr jaggers â\\x80\\x9cthatâ\\x80\\x99s my answerâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nas we looked full at one another i felt my breath come quicker in my\\nstrong desire to get something out of him and as i felt that it came\\nquicker and as i felt that he saw that it came quicker i felt that i\\nhad less chance than ever of getting anything out of him\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cdo you suppose it will still be years hence mr jaggersâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nmr jaggers shook his headâ\\x80\\x94not in negativing the question but in\\naltogether negativing the notion that he could anyhow be got to answer\\nitâ\\x80\\x94and the two horrible casts of the twitched faces looked when my\\neyes strayed up to them as if they had come to a crisis in their\\nsuspended attention and were going to sneeze\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ccomeâ\\x80\\x9d said mr jaggers warming the backs of his legs with the backs\\nof his warmed hands â\\x80\\x9ciâ\\x80\\x99ll be plain with you my friend pip thatâ\\x80\\x99s a\\nquestion i must not be asked youâ\\x80\\x99ll understand that better when i\\ntell you itâ\\x80\\x99s a question that might compromise me come iâ\\x80\\x99ll go a\\nlittle further with you iâ\\x80\\x99ll say something moreâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nhe bent down so low to frown at his boots that he was able to rub the\\ncalves of his legs in the pause he made\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhen that person disclosesâ\\x80\\x9d said mr jaggers straightening himself\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou and that person will settle your own affairs when that person\\ndiscloses my part in this business will cease and determine when that\\nperson discloses it will not be necessary for me to know anything\\nabout it and thatâ\\x80\\x99s all i have got to sayâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nwe looked at one another until i withdrew my eyes and looked\\nthoughtfully at the floor from this last speech i derived the notion\\nthat miss havisham for some reason or no reason had not taken him\\ninto her confidence as to her designing me for estella that he\\nresented this and felt a jealousy about it or that he really did\\nobject to that scheme and would have nothing to do with it when i\\nraised my eyes again i found that he had been shrewdly looking at me\\nall the time and was doing so still\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cif that is all you have to say sirâ\\x80\\x9d i remarked â\\x80\\x9cthere can be\\nnothing left for me to sayâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nhe nodded assent and pulled out his thiefdreaded watch and asked me\\nwhere i was going to dine i replied at my own chambers with herbert\\nas a necessary sequence i asked him if he would favour us with his\\ncompany and he promptly accepted the invitation but he insisted on\\nwalking home with me in order that i might make no extra preparation\\nfor him and first he had a letter or two to write and of course had\\nhis hands to wash so i said i would go into the outer office and talk\\nto wemmick\\n\\nthe fact was that when the five hundred pounds had come into my\\npocket a thought had come into my head which had been often there\\nbefore and it appeared to me that wemmick was a good person to advise\\nwith concerning such thought\\n\\nhe had already locked up his safe and made preparations for going\\nhome he had left his desk brought out his two greasy office\\ncandlesticks and stood them in line with the snuffers on a slab near\\nthe door ready to be extinguished he had raked his fire low put his\\nhat and greatcoat ready and was beating himself all over the chest\\nwith his safekey as an athletic exercise after business\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmr wemmickâ\\x80\\x9d said i â\\x80\\x9ci want to ask your opinion i am very desirous\\nto serve a friendâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nwemmick tightened his postoffice and shook his head as if his opinion\\nwere dead against any fatal weakness of that sort\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthis friendâ\\x80\\x9d i pursued â\\x80\\x9cis trying to get on in commercial life but\\nhas no money and finds it difficult and disheartening to make a\\nbeginning now i want somehow to help him to a beginningâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwith money downâ\\x80\\x9d said wemmick in a tone drier than any sawdust\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwith some money downâ\\x80\\x9d i replied for an uneasy remembrance shot\\nacross me of that symmetrical bundle of papers at homeâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cwith some\\nmoney down and perhaps some anticipation of my expectationsâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmr pipâ\\x80\\x9d said wemmick â\\x80\\x9ci should like just to run over with you on my\\nfingers if you please the names of the various bridges up as high as\\nchelsea reach letâ\\x80\\x99s see thereâ\\x80\\x99s london one southwark two\\nblackfriars three waterloo four westminster five vauxhall sixâ\\x80\\x9d\\nhe had checked off each bridge in its turn with the handle of his\\nsafekey on the palm of his hand â\\x80\\x9cthereâ\\x80\\x99s as many as six you see to\\nchoose fromâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci donâ\\x80\\x99t understand youâ\\x80\\x9d said i\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cchoose your bridge mr pipâ\\x80\\x9d returned wemmick â\\x80\\x9cand take a walk upon\\nyour bridge and pitch your money into the thames over the centre arch\\nof your bridge and you know the end of it serve a friend with it and\\nyou may know the end of it tooâ\\x80\\x94but itâ\\x80\\x99s a less pleasant and profitable\\nendâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni could have posted a newspaper in his mouth he made it so wide after\\nsaying this\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthis is very discouragingâ\\x80\\x9d said i\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmeant to be soâ\\x80\\x9d said wemmick\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthen is it your opinionâ\\x80\\x9d i inquired with some little indignation\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthat a man should neverâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x94invest portable property in a friendâ\\x80\\x9d said wemmick â\\x80\\x9ccertainly he\\nshould not unless he wants to get rid of the friendâ\\x80\\x94and then it\\nbecomes a question how much portable property it may be worth to get\\nrid of himâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cand thatâ\\x80\\x9d said i â\\x80\\x9cis your deliberate opinion mr wemmickâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthatâ\\x80\\x9d he returned â\\x80\\x9cis my deliberate opinion in this officeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cahâ\\x80\\x9d said i pressing him for i thought i saw him near a loophole\\nhere â\\x80\\x9cbut would that be your opinion at walworthâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmr pipâ\\x80\\x9d he replied with gravity â\\x80\\x9cwalworth is one place and this\\noffice is another much as the aged is one person and mr jaggers is\\nanother they must not be confounded together my walworth sentiments\\nmust be taken at walworth none but my official sentiments can be taken\\nin this officeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cvery wellâ\\x80\\x9d said i much relieved â\\x80\\x9cthen i shall look you up at\\nwalworth you may depend upon itâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmr pipâ\\x80\\x9d he returned â\\x80\\x9cyou will be welcome there in a private and\\npersonal capacityâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nwe had held this conversation in a low voice well knowing my\\nguardianâ\\x80\\x99s ears to be the sharpest of the sharp as he now appeared in\\nhis doorway towelling his hands wemmick got on his greatcoat and\\nstood by to snuff out the candles we all three went into the street\\ntogether and from the doorstep wemmick turned his way and mr\\njaggers and i turned ours\\n\\ni could not help wishing more than once that evening that mr jaggers\\nhad had an aged in gerrard street or a stinger or a something or a\\nsomebody to unbend his brows a little it was an uncomfortable\\nconsideration on a twentyfirst birthday that coming of age at all\\nseemed hardly worth while in such a guarded and suspicious world as he\\nmade of it he was a thousand times better informed and cleverer than\\nwemmick and yet i would a thousand times rather have had wemmick to\\ndinner and mr jaggers made not me alone intensely melancholy\\nbecause after he was gone herbert said of himself with his eyes\\nfixed on the fire that he thought he must have committed a felony and\\nforgotten the details of it he felt so dejected and guilty\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter xxxvii\\n\\n\\ndeeming sunday the best day for taking mr wemmickâ\\x80\\x99s walworth\\nsentiments i devoted the next ensuing sunday afternoon to a pilgrimage\\nto the castle on arriving before the battlements i found the union\\njack flying and the drawbridge up but undeterred by this show of\\ndefiance and resistance i rang at the gate and was admitted in a most\\npacific manner by the aged\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmy son sirâ\\x80\\x9d said the old man after securing the drawbridge â\\x80\\x9crather\\nhad it in his mind that you might happen to drop in and he left word\\nthat he would soon be home from his afternoonâ\\x80\\x99s walk he is very\\nregular in his walks is my son very regular in everything is my\\nsonâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni nodded at the old gentleman as wemmick himself might have nodded and\\nwe went in and sat down by the fireside\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou made acquaintance with my son sirâ\\x80\\x9d said the old man in his\\nchirping way while he warmed his hands at the blaze â\\x80\\x9cat his office i\\nexpectâ\\x80\\x9d i nodded â\\x80\\x9chah i have heerd that my son is a wonderful hand\\nat his business sirâ\\x80\\x9d i nodded hard â\\x80\\x9cyes so they tell me his\\nbusiness is the lawâ\\x80\\x9d i nodded harder â\\x80\\x9cwhich makes it more surprising\\nin my sonâ\\x80\\x9d said the old man â\\x80\\x9cfor he was not brought up to the law\\nbut to the winecooperingâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ncurious to know how the old gentleman stood informed concerning the\\nreputation of mr jaggers i roared that name at him he threw me into\\nthe greatest confusion by laughing heartily and replying in a very\\nsprightly manner â\\x80\\x9cno to be sure youâ\\x80\\x99re rightâ\\x80\\x9d and to this hour i\\nhave not the faintest notion what he meant or what joke he thought i\\nhad made\\n\\nas i could not sit there nodding at him perpetually without making\\nsome other attempt to interest him i shouted at inquiry whether his\\nown calling in life had been â\\x80\\x9cthe winecooperingâ\\x80\\x9d by dint of straining\\nthat term out of myself several times and tapping the old gentleman on\\nthe chest to associate it with him i at last succeeded in making my\\nmeaning understood\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnoâ\\x80\\x9d said the old gentleman â\\x80\\x9cthe warehousing the warehousing first\\nover yonderâ\\x80\\x9d he appeared to mean up the chimney but i believe he\\nintended to refer me to liverpool â\\x80\\x9cand then in the city of london\\nhere however having an infirmityâ\\x80\\x94for i am hard of hearing sirâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni expressed in pantomime the greatest astonishment\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x94yes hard of hearing having that infirmity coming upon me my son he\\nwent into the law and he took charge of me and he by little and\\nlittle made out this elegant and beautiful property but returning to\\nwhat you said you knowâ\\x80\\x9d pursued the old man again laughing heartily\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhat i say is no to be sure youâ\\x80\\x99re rightâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni was modestly wondering whether my utmost ingenuity would have enabled\\nme to say anything that would have amused him half as much as this\\nimaginary pleasantry when i was startled by a sudden click in the wall\\non one side of the chimney and the ghostly tumbling open of a little\\nwooden flap with â\\x80\\x9cjohnâ\\x80\\x9d upon it the old man following my eyes cried\\nwith great triumph â\\x80\\x9cmy sonâ\\x80\\x99s come homeâ\\x80\\x9d and we both went out to the\\ndrawbridge\\n\\nit was worth any money to see wemmick waving a salute to me from the\\nother side of the moat when we might have shaken hands across it with\\nthe greatest ease the aged was so delighted to work the drawbridge\\nthat i made no offer to assist him but stood quiet until wemmick had\\ncome across and had presented me to miss skiffins a lady by whom he\\nwas accompanied\\n\\nmiss skiffins was of a wooden appearance and was like her escort in\\nthe postoffice branch of the service she might have been some two or\\nthree years younger than wemmick and i judged her to stand possessed\\nof portable property the cut of her dress from the waist upward both\\nbefore and behind made her figure very like a boyâ\\x80\\x99s kite and i might\\nhave pronounced her gown a little too decidedly orange and her gloves\\na little too intensely green but she seemed to be a good sort of\\nfellow and showed a high regard for the aged i was not long in\\ndiscovering that she was a frequent visitor at the castle for on our\\ngoing in and my complimenting wemmick on his ingenious contrivance for\\nannouncing himself to the aged he begged me to give my attention for a\\nmoment to the other side of the chimney and disappeared presently\\nanother click came and another little door tumbled open with â\\x80\\x9cmiss\\nskiffinsâ\\x80\\x9d on it then miss skiffins shut up and john tumbled open then\\nmiss skiffins and john both tumbled open together and finally shut up\\ntogether on wemmickâ\\x80\\x99s return from working these mechanical appliances\\ni expressed the great admiration with which i regarded them and he\\nsaid â\\x80\\x9cwell you know theyâ\\x80\\x99re both pleasant and useful to the aged\\nand by george sir itâ\\x80\\x99s a thing worth mentioning that of all the\\npeople who come to this gate the secret of those pulls is only known\\nto the aged miss skiffins and meâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cand mr wemmick made themâ\\x80\\x9d added miss skiffins â\\x80\\x9cwith his own hands\\nout of his own headâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nwhile miss skiffins was taking off her bonnet she retained her green\\ngloves during the evening as an outward and visible sign that there was\\ncompany wemmick invited me to take a walk with him round the\\nproperty and see how the island looked in wintertime thinking that he\\ndid this to give me an opportunity of taking his walworth sentiments i\\nseized the opportunity as soon as we were out of the castle\\n\\nhaving thought of the matter with care i approached my subject as if i\\nhad never hinted at it before i informed wemmick that i was anxious in\\nbehalf of herbert pocket and i told him how we had first met and how\\nwe had fought i glanced at herbertâ\\x80\\x99s home and at his character and\\nat his having no means but such as he was dependent on his father for\\nthose uncertain and unpunctual i alluded to the advantages i had\\nderived in my first rawness and ignorance from his society and i\\nconfessed that i feared i had but ill repaid them and that he might\\nhave done better without me and my expectations keeping miss havisham\\nin the background at a great distance i still hinted at the\\npossibility of my having competed with him in his prospects and at the\\ncertainty of his possessing a generous soul and being far above any\\nmean distrusts retaliations or designs for all these reasons i told\\nwemmick and because he was my young companion and friend and i had a\\ngreat affection for him i wished my own good fortune to reflect some\\nrays upon him and therefore i sought advice from wemmickâ\\x80\\x99s experience\\nand knowledge of men and affairs how i could best try with my\\nresources to help herbert to some present incomeâ\\x80\\x94say of a hundred a\\nyear to keep him in good hope and heartâ\\x80\\x94and gradually to buy him on\\nto some small partnership i begged wemmick in conclusion to\\nunderstand that my help must always be rendered without herbertâ\\x80\\x99s\\nknowledge or suspicion and that there was no one else in the world\\nwith whom i could advise i wound up by laying my hand upon his\\nshoulder and saying â\\x80\\x9ci canâ\\x80\\x99t help confiding in you though i know it\\nmust be troublesome to you but that is your fault in having ever\\nbrought me hereâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nwemmick was silent for a little while and then said with a kind of\\nstart â\\x80\\x9cwell you know mr pip i must tell you one thing this is\\ndevilish good of youâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9csay youâ\\x80\\x99ll help me to be good thenâ\\x80\\x9d said i\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cecodâ\\x80\\x9d replied wemmick shaking his head â\\x80\\x9cthatâ\\x80\\x99s not my tradeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnor is this your tradingplaceâ\\x80\\x9d said i\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou are rightâ\\x80\\x9d he returned â\\x80\\x9cyou hit the nail on the head mr pip\\niâ\\x80\\x99ll put on my consideringcap and i think all you want to do may be\\ndone by degrees skiffins thatâ\\x80\\x99s her brother is an accountant and\\nagent iâ\\x80\\x99ll look him up and go to work for youâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci thank you ten thousand timesâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9con the contraryâ\\x80\\x9d said he â\\x80\\x9ci thank you for though we are strictly in\\nour private and personal capacity still it may be mentioned that there\\nare newgate cobwebs about and it brushes them awayâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nafter a little further conversation to the same effect we returned\\ninto the castle where we found miss skiffins preparing tea the\\nresponsible duty of making the toast was delegated to the aged and\\nthat excellent old gentleman was so intent upon it that he seemed to me\\nin some danger of melting his eyes it was no nominal meal that we were\\ngoing to make but a vigorous reality the aged prepared such a\\nhaystack of buttered toast that i could scarcely see him over it as\\nit simmered on an iron stand hooked on to the topbar while miss\\nskiffins brewed such a jorum of tea that the pig in the back premises\\nbecame strongly excited and repeatedly expressed his desire to\\nparticipate in the entertainment\\n\\nthe flag had been struck and the gun had been fired at the right\\nmoment of time and i felt as snugly cut off from the rest of walworth\\nas if the moat were thirty feet wide by as many deep nothing disturbed\\nthe tranquillity of the castle but the occasional tumbling open of\\njohn and miss skiffins which little doors were a prey to some\\nspasmodic infirmity that made me sympathetically uncomfortable until i\\ngot used to it i inferred from the methodical nature of miss\\nskiffinsâ\\x80\\x99s arrangements that she made tea there every sunday night and\\ni rather suspected that a classic brooch she wore representing the\\nprofile of an undesirable female with a very straight nose and a very\\nnew moon was a piece of portable property that had been given her by\\nwemmick\\n\\nwe ate the whole of the toast and drank tea in proportion and it was\\ndelightful to see how warm and greasy we all got after it the aged\\nespecially might have passed for some clean old chief of a savage\\ntribe just oiled after a short pause of repose miss skiffinsâ\\x80\\x94in the\\nabsence of the little servant who it seemed retired to the bosom of\\nher family on sunday afternoonsâ\\x80\\x94washed up the teathings in a trifling\\nladylike amateur manner that compromised none of us then she put on\\nher gloves again and we drew round the fire and wemmick said â\\x80\\x9cnow\\naged parent tip us the paperâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nwemmick explained to me while the aged got his spectacles out that\\nthis was according to custom and that it gave the old gentleman\\ninfinite satisfaction to read the news aloud â\\x80\\x9ci wonâ\\x80\\x99t offer an\\napologyâ\\x80\\x9d said wemmick â\\x80\\x9cfor he isnâ\\x80\\x99t capable of many pleasuresâ\\x80\\x94are\\nyou aged pâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9call right john all rightâ\\x80\\x9d returned the old man seeing himself\\nspoken to\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9conly tip him a nod every now and then when he looks off his paperâ\\x80\\x9d\\nsaid wemmick â\\x80\\x9cand heâ\\x80\\x99ll be as happy as a king we are all attention\\naged oneâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9call right john all rightâ\\x80\\x9d returned the cheerful old man so busy\\nand so pleased that it really was quite charming\\n\\nthe agedâ\\x80\\x99s reading reminded me of the classes at mr wopsleâ\\x80\\x99s\\ngreatauntâ\\x80\\x99s with the pleasanter peculiarity that it seemed to come\\nthrough a keyhole as he wanted the candles close to him and as he was\\nalways on the verge of putting either his head or the newspaper into\\nthem he required as much watching as a powdermill but wemmick was\\nequally untiring and gentle in his vigilance and the aged read on\\nquite unconscious of his many rescues whenever he looked at us we all\\nexpressed the greatest interest and amazement and nodded until he\\nresumed again\\n\\nas wemmick and miss skiffins sat side by side and as i sat in a\\nshadowy corner i observed a slow and gradual elongation of mr\\nwemmickâ\\x80\\x99s mouth powerfully suggestive of his slowly and gradually\\nstealing his arm round miss skiffinsâ\\x80\\x99s waist in course of time i saw\\nhis hand appear on the other side of miss skiffins but at that moment\\nmiss skiffins neatly stopped him with the green glove unwound his arm\\nagain as if it were an article of dress and with the greatest\\ndeliberation laid it on the table before her miss skiffinsâ\\x80\\x99s composure\\nwhile she did this was one of the most remarkable sights i have ever\\nseen and if i could have thought the act consistent with abstraction\\nof mind i should have deemed that miss skiffins performed it\\nmechanically\\n\\nby and by i noticed wemmickâ\\x80\\x99s arm beginning to disappear again and\\ngradually fading out of view shortly afterwards his mouth began to\\nwiden again after an interval of suspense on my part that was quite\\nenthralling and almost painful i saw his hand appear on the other side\\nof miss skiffins instantly miss skiffins stopped it with the neatness\\nof a placid boxer took off that girdle or cestus as before and laid\\nit on the table taking the table to represent the path of virtue i am\\njustified in stating that during the whole time of the agedâ\\x80\\x99s reading\\nwemmickâ\\x80\\x99s arm was straying from the path of virtue and being recalled\\nto it by miss skiffins\\n\\nat last the aged read himself into a light slumber this was the time\\nfor wemmick to produce a little kettle a tray of glasses and a black\\nbottle with a porcelaintopped cork representing some clerical\\ndignitary of a rubicund and social aspect with the aid of these\\nappliances we all had something warm to drink including the aged who\\nwas soon awake again miss skiffins mixed and i observed that she and\\nwemmick drank out of one glass of course i knew better than to offer\\nto see miss skiffins home and under the circumstances i thought i had\\nbest go first which i did taking a cordial leave of the aged and\\nhaving passed a pleasant evening\\n\\nbefore a week was out i received a note from wemmick dated walworth\\nstating that he hoped he had made some advance in that matter\\nappertaining to our private and personal capacities and that he would\\nbe glad if i could come and see him again upon it so i went out to\\nwalworth again and yet again and yet again and i saw him by\\nappointment in the city several times but never held any communication\\nwith him on the subject in or near little britain the upshot was that\\nwe found a worthy young merchant or shippingbroker not long\\nestablished in business who wanted intelligent help and who wanted\\ncapital and who in due course of time and receipt would want a\\npartner between him and me secret articles were signed of which\\nherbert was the subject and i paid him half of my five hundred pounds\\ndown and engaged for sundry other payments some to fall due at\\ncertain dates out of my income some contingent on my coming into my\\nproperty miss skiffinsâ\\x80\\x99s brother conducted the negotiation wemmick\\npervaded it throughout but never appeared in it\\n\\nthe whole business was so cleverly managed that herbert had not the\\nleast suspicion of my hand being in it i never shall forget the\\nradiant face with which he came home one afternoon and told me as a\\nmighty piece of news of his having fallen in with one clarriker the\\nyoung merchantâ\\x80\\x99s name and of clarrikerâ\\x80\\x99s having shown an\\nextraordinary inclination towards him and of his belief that the\\nopening had come at last day by day as his hopes grew stronger and his\\nface brighter he must have thought me a more and more affectionate\\nfriend for i had the greatest difficulty in restraining my tears of\\ntriumph when i saw him so happy at length the thing being done and\\nhe having that day entered clarrikerâ\\x80\\x99s house and he having talked to\\nme for a whole evening in a flush of pleasure and success i did really\\ncry in good earnest when i went to bed to think that my expectations\\nhad done some good to somebody\\n\\na great event in my life the turning point of my life now opens on my\\nview but before i proceed to narrate it and before i pass on to all\\nthe changes it involved i must give one chapter to estella it is not\\nmuch to give to the theme that so long filled my heart\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter xxxviii\\n\\n\\nif that staid old house near the green at richmond should ever come to\\nbe haunted when i am dead it will be haunted surely by my ghost o\\nthe many many nights and days through which the unquiet spirit within\\nme haunted that house when estella lived there let my body be where it\\nwould my spirit was always wandering wandering wandering about that\\nhouse\\n\\nthe lady with whom estella was placed mrs brandley by name was a\\nwidow with one daughter several years older than estella the mother\\nlooked young and the daughter looked old the motherâ\\x80\\x99s complexion was\\npink and the daughterâ\\x80\\x99s was yellow the mother set up for frivolity\\nand the daughter for theology they were in what is called a good\\nposition and visited and were visited by numbers of people little\\nif any community of feeling subsisted between them and estella but\\nthe understanding was established that they were necessary to her and\\nthat she was necessary to them mrs brandley had been a friend of miss\\nhavishamâ\\x80\\x99s before the time of her seclusion\\n\\nin mrs brandleyâ\\x80\\x99s house and out of mrs brandleyâ\\x80\\x99s house i suffered\\nevery kind and degree of torture that estella could cause me the\\nnature of my relations with her which placed me on terms of\\nfamiliarity without placing me on terms of favour conduced to my\\ndistraction she made use of me to tease other admirers and she turned\\nthe very familiarity between herself and me to the account of putting a\\nconstant slight on my devotion to her if i had been her secretary\\nsteward halfbrother poor relationâ\\x80\\x94if i had been a younger brother\\nof her appointed husbandâ\\x80\\x94i could not have seemed to myself further\\nfrom my hopes when i was nearest to her the privilege of calling her\\nby her name and hearing her call me by mine became under the\\ncircumstances an aggravation of my trials and while i think it likely\\nthat it almost maddened her other lovers i know too certainly that it\\nalmost maddened me\\n\\nshe had admirers without end no doubt my jealousy made an admirer of\\nevery one who went near her but there were more than enough of them\\nwithout that\\n\\ni saw her often at richmond i heard of her often in town and i used\\noften to take her and the brandleys on the water there were picnics\\nfãªte days plays operas concerts parties all sorts of pleasures\\nthrough which i pursued herâ\\x80\\x94and they were all miseries to me i never\\nhad one hourâ\\x80\\x99s happiness in her society and yet my mind all round the\\nfourandtwenty hours was harping on the happiness of having her with\\nme unto death\\n\\nthroughout this part of our intercourseâ\\x80\\x94and it lasted as will\\npresently be seen for what i then thought a long timeâ\\x80\\x94she habitually\\nreverted to that tone which expressed that our association was forced\\nupon us there were other times when she would come to a sudden check\\nin this tone and in all her many tones and would seem to pity me\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cpip pipâ\\x80\\x9d she said one evening coming to such a check when we sat\\napart at a darkening window of the house in richmond â\\x80\\x9cwill you never\\ntake warningâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cof whatâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cof meâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwarning not to be attracted by you do you mean estellaâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cdo i mean if you donâ\\x80\\x99t know what i mean you are blindâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni should have replied that love was commonly reputed blind but for the\\nreason that i always was restrainedâ\\x80\\x94and this was not the least of my\\nmiseriesâ\\x80\\x94by a feeling that it was ungenerous to press myself upon her\\nwhen she knew that she could not choose but obey miss havisham my\\ndread always was that this knowledge on her part laid me under a heavy\\ndisadvantage with her pride and made me the subject of a rebellious\\nstruggle in her bosom\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cat any rateâ\\x80\\x9d said i â\\x80\\x9ci have no warning given me just now for you\\nwrote to me to come to you this timeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthatâ\\x80\\x99s trueâ\\x80\\x9d said estella with a cold careless smile that always\\nchilled me\\n\\nafter looking at the twilight without for a little while she went on\\nto sayâ\\x80\\x94\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthe time has come round when miss havisham wishes to have me for a day\\nat satis you are to take me there and bring me back if you will she\\nwould rather i did not travel alone and objects to receiving my maid\\nfor she has a sensitive horror of being talked of by such people can\\nyou take meâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ccan i take you estellaâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou can then the day after tomorrow if you please you are to pay\\nall charges out of my purse you hear the condition of your goingâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cand must obeyâ\\x80\\x9d said i\\n\\nthis was all the preparation i received for that visit or for others\\nlike it miss havisham never wrote to me nor had i ever so much as\\nseen her handwriting we went down on the next day but one and we\\nfound her in the room where i had first beheld her and it is needless\\nto add that there was no change in satis house\\n\\nshe was even more dreadfully fond of estella than she had been when i\\nlast saw them together i repeat the word advisedly for there was\\nsomething positively dreadful in the energy of her looks and embraces\\nshe hung upon estellaâ\\x80\\x99s beauty hung upon her words hung upon her\\ngestures and sat mumbling her own trembling fingers while she looked\\nat her as though she were devouring the beautiful creature she had\\nreared\\n\\nfrom estella she looked at me with a searching glance that seemed to\\npry into my heart and probe its wounds â\\x80\\x9chow does she use you pip how\\ndoes she use youâ\\x80\\x9d she asked me again with her witchlike eagerness\\neven in estellaâ\\x80\\x99s hearing but when we sat by her flickering fire at\\nnight she was most weird for then keeping estellaâ\\x80\\x99s hand drawn\\nthrough her arm and clutched in her own hand she extorted from her by\\ndint of referring back to what estella had told her in her regular\\nletters the names and conditions of the men whom she had fascinated\\nand as miss havisham dwelt upon this roll with the intensity of a mind\\nmortally hurt and diseased she sat with her other hand on her crutch\\nstick and her chin on that and her wan bright eyes glaring at me a\\nvery spectre\\n\\ni saw in this wretched though it made me and bitter the sense of\\ndependence and even of degradation that it awakenedâ\\x80\\x94i saw in this that\\nestella was set to wreak miss havishamâ\\x80\\x99s revenge on men and that she\\nwas not to be given to me until she had gratified it for a term i saw\\nin this a reason for her being beforehand assigned to me sending her\\nout to attract and torment and do mischief miss havisham sent her with\\nthe malicious assurance that she was beyond the reach of all admirers\\nand that all who staked upon that cast were secured to lose i saw in\\nthis that i too was tormented by a perversion of ingenuity even\\nwhile the prize was reserved for me i saw in this the reason for my\\nbeing staved off so long and the reason for my late guardianâ\\x80\\x99s\\ndeclining to commit himself to the formal knowledge of such a scheme\\nin a word i saw in this miss havisham as i had her then and there\\nbefore my eyes and always had had her before my eyes and i saw in\\nthis the distinct shadow of the darkened and unhealthy house in which\\nher life was hidden from the sun\\n\\nthe candles that lighted that room of hers were placed in sconces on\\nthe wall they were high from the ground and they burnt with the\\nsteady dulness of artificial light in air that is seldom renewed as i\\nlooked round at them and at the pale gloom they made and at the\\nstopped clock and at the withered articles of bridal dress upon the\\ntable and the ground and at her own awful figure with its ghostly\\nreflection thrown large by the fire upon the ceiling and the wall i\\nsaw in everything the construction that my mind had come to repeated\\nand thrown back to me my thoughts passed into the great room across\\nthe landing where the table was spread and i saw it written as it\\nwere in the falls of the cobwebs from the centrepiece in the\\ncrawlings of the spiders on the cloth in the tracks of the mice as\\nthey betook their little quickened hearts behind the panels and in the\\ngropings and pausings of the beetles on the floor\\n\\nit happened on the occasion of this visit that some sharp words arose\\nbetween estella and miss havisham it was the first time i had ever\\nseen them opposed\\n\\nwe were seated by the fire as just now described and miss havisham\\nstill had estellaâ\\x80\\x99s arm drawn through her own and still clutched\\nestellaâ\\x80\\x99s hand in hers when estella gradually began to detach herself\\nshe had shown a proud impatience more than once before and had rather\\nendured that fierce affection than accepted or returned it\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhatâ\\x80\\x9d said miss havisham flashing her eyes upon her â\\x80\\x9care you tired\\nof meâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9conly a little tired of myselfâ\\x80\\x9d replied estella disengaging her arm\\nand moving to the great chimneypiece where she stood looking down at\\nthe fire\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cspeak the truth you ingrateâ\\x80\\x9d cried miss havisham passionately\\nstriking her stick upon the floor â\\x80\\x9cyou are tired of meâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nestella looked at her with perfect composure and again looked down at\\nthe fire her graceful figure and her beautiful face expressed a\\nselfpossessed indifference to the wild heat of the other that was\\nalmost cruel\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou stock and stoneâ\\x80\\x9d exclaimed miss havisham â\\x80\\x9cyou cold cold heartâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhatâ\\x80\\x9d said estella preserving her attitude of indifference as she\\nleaned against the great chimneypiece and only moving her eyes â\\x80\\x9cdo\\nyou reproach me for being cold youâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9care you notâ\\x80\\x9d was the fierce retort\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou should knowâ\\x80\\x9d said estella â\\x80\\x9ci am what you have made me take all\\nthe praise take all the blame take all the success take all the\\nfailure in short take meâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9co look at her look at herâ\\x80\\x9d cried miss havisham bitterly â\\x80\\x9clook at\\nher so hard and thankless on the hearth where she was reared where i\\ntook her into this wretched breast when it was first bleeding from its\\nstabs and where i have lavished years of tenderness upon herâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nillustration\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cat least i was no party to the compactâ\\x80\\x9d said estella â\\x80\\x9cfor if i could\\nwalk and speak when it was made it was as much as i could do but\\nwhat would you have you have been very good to me and i owe\\neverything to you what would you haveâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cloveâ\\x80\\x9d replied the other\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou have itâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci have notâ\\x80\\x9d said miss havisham\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmother by adoptionâ\\x80\\x9d retorted estella never departing from the easy\\ngrace of her attitude never raising her voice as the other did never\\nyielding either to anger or tendernessâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cmother by adoption i have\\nsaid that i owe everything to you all i possess is freely yours all\\nthat you have given me is at your command to have again beyond that\\ni have nothing and if you ask me to give you what you never gave me\\nmy gratitude and duty cannot do impossibilitiesâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cdid i never give her loveâ\\x80\\x9d cried miss havisham turning wildly to me\\nâ\\x80\\x9cdid i never give her a burning love inseparable from jealousy at all\\ntimes and from sharp pain while she speaks thus to me let her call\\nme mad let her call me madâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhy should i call you madâ\\x80\\x9d returned estella â\\x80\\x9ci of all people does\\nany one live who knows what set purposes you have half as well as i\\ndo does any one live who knows what a steady memory you have half as\\nwell as i do i who have sat on this same hearth on the little stool\\nthat is even now beside you there learning your lessons and looking up\\ninto your face when your face was strange and frightened meâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9csoon forgottenâ\\x80\\x9d moaned miss havisham â\\x80\\x9ctimes soon forgottenâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cno not forgottenâ\\x80\\x9d retorted estellaâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cnot forgotten but treasured up\\nin my memory when have you found me false to your teaching when have\\nyou found me unmindful of your lessons when have you found me giving\\nadmission hereâ\\x80\\x9d she touched her bosom with her hand â\\x80\\x9cto anything that\\nyou excluded be just to meâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cso proud so proudâ\\x80\\x9d moaned miss havisham pushing away her grey hair\\nwith both her hands\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwho taught me to be proudâ\\x80\\x9d returned estella â\\x80\\x9cwho praised me when i\\nlearnt my lessonâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cso hard so hardâ\\x80\\x9d moaned miss havisham with her former action\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwho taught me to be hardâ\\x80\\x9d returned estella â\\x80\\x9cwho praised me when i\\nlearnt my lessonâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbut to be proud and hard to meâ\\x80\\x9d miss havisham quite shrieked as\\nshe stretched out her arms â\\x80\\x9cestella estella estella to be proud and\\nhard to meâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nestella looked at her for a moment with a kind of calm wonder but was\\nnot otherwise disturbed when the moment was past she looked down at\\nthe fire again\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci cannot thinkâ\\x80\\x9d said estella raising her eyes after a silence â\\x80\\x9cwhy\\nyou should be so unreasonable when i come to see you after a\\nseparation i have never forgotten your wrongs and their causes i have\\nnever been unfaithful to you or your schooling i have never shown any\\nweakness that i can charge myself withâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwould it be weakness to return my loveâ\\x80\\x9d exclaimed miss havisham â\\x80\\x9cbut\\nyes yes she would call it soâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci begin to thinkâ\\x80\\x9d said estella in a musing way after another moment\\nof calm wonder â\\x80\\x9cthat i almost understand how this comes about if you\\nhad brought up your adopted daughter wholly in the dark confinement of\\nthese rooms and had never let her know that there was such a thing as\\nthe daylight by which she had never once seen your faceâ\\x80\\x94if you had\\ndone that and then for a purpose had wanted her to understand the\\ndaylight and know all about it you would have been disappointed and\\nangryâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nmiss havisham with her head in her hands sat making a low moaning\\nand swaying herself on her chair but gave no answer\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9corâ\\x80\\x9d said estellaâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cwhich is a nearer caseâ\\x80\\x94if you had taught her\\nfrom the dawn of her intelligence with your utmost energy and might\\nthat there was such a thing as daylight but that it was made to be her\\nenemy and destroyer and she must always turn against it for it had\\nblighted you and would else blight herâ\\x80\\x94if you had done this and then\\nfor a purpose had wanted her to take naturally to the daylight and she\\ncould not do it you would have been disappointed and angryâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nmiss havisham sat listening or it seemed so for i could not see her\\nface but still made no answer\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9csoâ\\x80\\x9d said estella â\\x80\\x9ci must be taken as i have been made the success\\nis not mine the failure is not mine but the two together make meâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nmiss havisham had settled down i hardly knew how upon the floor\\namong the faded bridal relics with which it was strewn i took\\nadvantage of the momentâ\\x80\\x94i had sought one from the firstâ\\x80\\x94to leave the\\nroom after beseeching estellaâ\\x80\\x99s attention to her with a movement of\\nmy hand when i left estella was yet standing by the great\\nchimneypiece just as she had stood throughout miss havishamâ\\x80\\x99s grey\\nhair was all adrift upon the ground among the other bridal wrecks and\\nwas a miserable sight to see\\n\\nit was with a depressed heart that i walked in the starlight for an\\nhour and more about the courtyard and about the brewery and about\\nthe ruined garden when i at last took courage to return to the room i\\nfound estella sitting at miss havishamâ\\x80\\x99s knee taking up some stitches\\nin one of those old articles of dress that were dropping to pieces and\\nof which i have often been reminded since by the faded tatters of old\\nbanners that i have seen hanging up in cathedrals afterwards estella\\nand i played at cards as of yoreâ\\x80\\x94only we were skilful now and played\\nfrench gamesâ\\x80\\x94and so the evening wore away and i went to bed\\n\\ni lay in that separate building across the courtyard it was the first\\ntime i had ever lain down to rest in satis house and sleep refused to\\ncome near me a thousand miss havishams haunted me she was on this\\nside of my pillow on that at the head of the bed at the foot behind\\nthe halfopened door of the dressingroom in the dressingroom in the\\nroom overhead in the room beneathâ\\x80\\x94everywhere at last when the night\\nwas slow to creep on towards two oâ\\x80\\x99clock i felt that i absolutely\\ncould no longer bear the place as a place to lie down in and that i\\nmust get up i therefore got up and put on my clothes and went out\\nacross the yard into the long stone passage designing to gain the\\nouter courtyard and walk there for the relief of my mind but i was no\\nsooner in the passage than i extinguished my candle for i saw miss\\nhavisham going along it in a ghostly manner making a low cry i\\nfollowed her at a distance and saw her go up the staircase she\\ncarried a bare candle in her hand which she had probably taken from\\none of the sconces in her own room and was a most unearthly object by\\nits light standing at the bottom of the staircase i felt the mildewed\\nair of the feastchamber without seeing her open the door and i heard\\nher walking there and so across into her own room and so across again\\ninto that never ceasing the low cry after a time i tried in the dark\\nboth to get out and to go back but i could do neither until some\\nstreaks of day strayed in and showed me where to lay my hands during\\nthe whole interval whenever i went to the bottom of the staircase i\\nheard her footstep saw her light pass above and heard her ceaseless\\nlow cry\\n\\nbefore we left next day there was no revival of the difference between\\nher and estella nor was it ever revived on any similar occasion and\\nthere were four similar occasions to the best of my remembrance nor\\ndid miss havishamâ\\x80\\x99s manner towards estella in anywise change except\\nthat i believed it to have something like fear infused among its former\\ncharacteristics\\n\\nit is impossible to turn this leaf of my life without putting bentley\\ndrummleâ\\x80\\x99s name upon it or i would very gladly\\n\\non a certain occasion when the finches were assembled in force and\\nwhen good feeling was being promoted in the usual manner by nobodyâ\\x80\\x99s\\nagreeing with anybody else the presiding finch called the grove to\\norder forasmuch as mr drummle had not yet toasted a lady which\\naccording to the solemn constitution of the society it was the bruteâ\\x80\\x99s\\nturn to do that day i thought i saw him leer in an ugly way at me\\nwhile the decanters were going round but as there was no love lost\\nbetween us that might easily be what was my indignant surprise when\\nhe called upon the company to pledge him to â\\x80\\x9cestellaâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cestella whoâ\\x80\\x9d said i\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnever you mindâ\\x80\\x9d retorted drummle\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cestella of whereâ\\x80\\x9d said i â\\x80\\x9cyou are bound to say of whereâ\\x80\\x9d which he\\nwas as a finch\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cof richmond gentlemenâ\\x80\\x9d said drummle putting me out of the question\\nâ\\x80\\x9cand a peerless beautyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nmuch he knew about peerless beauties a mean miserable idiot i\\nwhispered herbert\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci know that ladyâ\\x80\\x9d said herbert across the table when the toast had\\nbeen honoured\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cdo youâ\\x80\\x9d said drummle\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cand so do iâ\\x80\\x9d i added with a scarlet face\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cdo youâ\\x80\\x9d said drummle â\\x80\\x9co lordâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthis was the only retortâ\\x80\\x94except glass or crockeryâ\\x80\\x94that the heavy\\ncreature was capable of making but i became as highly incensed by it\\nas if it had been barbed with wit and i immediately rose in my place\\nand said that i could not but regard it as being like the honourable\\nfinchâ\\x80\\x99s impudence to come down to that groveâ\\x80\\x94we always talked about\\ncoming down to that grove as a neat parliamentary turn of\\nexpressionâ\\x80\\x94down to that grove proposing a lady of whom he knew\\nnothing mr drummle upon this starting up demanded what i meant by\\nthat whereupon i made him the extreme reply that i believed he knew\\nwhere i was to be found\\n\\nwhether it was possible in a christian country to get on without blood\\nafter this was a question on which the finches were divided the\\ndebate upon it grew so lively indeed that at least six more\\nhonourable members told six more during the discussion that they\\nbelieved they knew where they were to be found however it was\\ndecided at last the grove being a court of honour that if mr drummle\\nwould bring never so slight a certificate from the lady importing that\\nhe had the honour of her acquaintance mr pip must express his regret\\nas a gentleman and a finch for â\\x80\\x9chaving been betrayed into a warmth\\nwhichâ\\x80\\x9d next day was appointed for the production lest our honour\\nshould take cold from delay and next day drummle appeared with a\\npolite little avowal in estellaâ\\x80\\x99s hand that she had had the honour of\\ndancing with him several times this left me no course but to regret\\nthat i had been â\\x80\\x9cbetrayed into a warmth whichâ\\x80\\x9d and on the whole to\\nrepudiate as untenable the idea that i was to be found anywhere\\ndrummle and i then sat snorting at one another for an hour while the\\ngrove engaged in indiscriminate contradiction and finally the\\npromotion of good feeling was declared to have gone ahead at an amazing\\nrate\\n\\ni tell this lightly but it was no light thing to me for i cannot\\nadequately express what pain it gave me to think that estella should\\nshow any favour to a contemptible clumsy sulky booby so very far\\nbelow the average to the present moment i believe it to have been\\nreferable to some pure fire of generosity and disinterestedness in my\\nlove for her that i could not endure the thought of her stooping to\\nthat hound no doubt i should have been miserable whomsoever she had\\nfavoured but a worthier object would have caused me a different kind\\nand degree of distress\\n\\nit was easy for me to find out and i did soon find out that drummle\\nhad begun to follow her closely and that she allowed him to do it a\\nlittle while and he was always in pursuit of her and he and i crossed\\none another every day he held on in a dull persistent way and\\nestella held him on now with encouragement now with discouragement\\nnow almost flattering him now openly despising him now knowing him\\nvery well now scarcely remembering who he was\\n\\nthe spider as mr jaggers had called him was used to lying in wait\\nhowever and had the patience of his tribe added to that he had a\\nblockhead confidence in his money and in his family greatness which\\nsometimes did him good serviceâ\\x80\\x94almost taking the place of\\nconcentration and determined purpose so the spider doggedly watching\\nestella outwatched many brighter insects and would often uncoil\\nhimself and drop at the right nick of time\\n\\nat a certain assembly ball at richmond there used to be assembly balls\\nat most places then where estella had outshone all other beauties\\nthis blundering drummle so hung about her and with so much toleration\\non her part that i resolved to speak to her concerning him i took the\\nnext opportunity which was when she was waiting for mrs blandley to\\ntake her home and was sitting apart among some flowers ready to go i\\nwas with her for i almost always accompanied them to and from such\\nplaces\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9care you tired estellaâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9crather pipâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou should beâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9csay rather i should not be for i have my letter to satis house to\\nwrite before i go to sleepâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9crecounting tonightâ\\x80\\x99s triumphâ\\x80\\x9d said i â\\x80\\x9csurely a very poor one\\nestellaâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhat do you mean i didnâ\\x80\\x99t know there had been anyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cestellaâ\\x80\\x9d said i â\\x80\\x9cdo look at that fellow in the corner yonder who is\\nlooking over here at usâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhy should i look at himâ\\x80\\x9d returned estella with her eyes on me\\ninstead â\\x80\\x9cwhat is there in that fellow in the corner yonderâ\\x80\\x94to use\\nyour wordsâ\\x80\\x94that i need look atâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cindeed that is the very question i want to ask youâ\\x80\\x9d said i â\\x80\\x9cfor he\\nhas been hovering about you all nightâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmoths and all sorts of ugly creaturesâ\\x80\\x9d replied estella with a\\nglance towards him â\\x80\\x9chover about a lighted candle can the candle help\\nitâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnoâ\\x80\\x9d i returned â\\x80\\x9cbut cannot the estella help itâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwellâ\\x80\\x9d said she laughing after a moment â\\x80\\x9cperhaps yes anything you\\nlikeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbut estella do hear me speak it makes me wretched that you should\\nencourage a man so generally despised as drummle you know he is\\ndespisedâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwellâ\\x80\\x9d said she\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou know he is as ungainly within as without a deficient\\nilltempered lowering stupid fellowâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwellâ\\x80\\x9d said she\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou know he has nothing to recommend him but money and a ridiculous\\nroll of addleheaded predecessors now donâ\\x80\\x99t youâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwellâ\\x80\\x9d said she again and each time she said it she opened her\\nlovely eyes the wider\\n\\nto overcome the difficulty of getting past that monosyllable i took it\\nfrom her and said repeating it with emphasis â\\x80\\x9cwell then that is\\nwhy it makes me wretchedâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nnow if i could have believed that she favoured drummle with any idea\\nof making meâ\\x80\\x94meâ\\x80\\x94wretched i should have been in better heart about it\\nbut in that habitual way of hers she put me so entirely out of the\\nquestion that i could believe nothing of the kind\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cpipâ\\x80\\x9d said estella casting her glance over the room â\\x80\\x9cdonâ\\x80\\x99t be\\nfoolish about its effect on you it may have its effect on others and\\nmay be meant to have itâ\\x80\\x99s not worth discussingâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyes it isâ\\x80\\x9d said i â\\x80\\x9cbecause i cannot bear that people should say\\nâ\\x80\\x98she throws away her graces and attractions on a mere boor the lowest\\nin the crowdâ\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci can bear itâ\\x80\\x9d said estella\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9coh donâ\\x80\\x99t be so proud estella and so inflexibleâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ccalls me proud and inflexible in this breathâ\\x80\\x9d said estella opening\\nher hands â\\x80\\x9cand in his last breath reproached me for stooping to a\\nboorâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthere is no doubt you doâ\\x80\\x9d said i something hurriedly â\\x80\\x9cfor i have\\nseen you give him looks and smiles this very night such as you never\\ngive toâ\\x80\\x94meâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cdo you want me thenâ\\x80\\x9d said estella turning suddenly with a fixed and\\nserious if not angry look â\\x80\\x9cto deceive and entrap youâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cdo you deceive and entrap him estellaâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyes and many othersâ\\x80\\x94all of them but you here is mrs brandley iâ\\x80\\x99ll\\nsay no moreâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nand now that i have given the one chapter to the theme that so filled\\nmy heart and so often made it ache and ache again i pass on\\nunhindered to the event that had impended over me longer yet the\\nevent that had begun to be prepared for before i knew that the world\\nheld estella and in the days when her baby intelligence was receiving\\nits first distortions from miss havishamâ\\x80\\x99s wasting hands\\n\\nin the eastern story the heavy slab that was to fall on the bed of\\nstate in the flush of conquest was slowly wrought out of the quarry\\nthe tunnel for the rope to hold it in its place was slowly carried\\nthrough the leagues of rock the slab was slowly raised and fitted in\\nthe roof the rope was rove to it and slowly taken through the miles of\\nhollow to the great iron ring all being made ready with much labour\\nand the hour come the sultan was aroused in the dead of the night and\\nthe sharpened axe that was to sever the rope from the great iron ring\\nwas put into his hand and he struck with it and the rope parted and\\nrushed away and the ceiling fell so in my case all the work near\\nand afar that tended to the end had been accomplished and in an\\ninstant the blow was struck and the roof of my stronghold dropped upon\\nme\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter xxxix\\n\\n\\ni was threeandtwenty years of age not another word had i heard to\\nenlighten me on the subject of my expectations and my twentythird\\nbirthday was a week gone we had left barnardâ\\x80\\x99s inn more than a year\\nand lived in the temple our chambers were in gardencourt down by the\\nriver\\n\\nmr pocket and i had for some time parted company as to our original\\nrelations though we continued on the best terms notwithstanding my\\ninability to settle to anythingâ\\x80\\x94which i hope arose out of the restless\\nand incomplete tenure on which i held my meansâ\\x80\\x94i had a taste for\\nreading and read regularly so many hours a day that matter of\\nherbertâ\\x80\\x99s was still progressing and everything with me was as i have\\nbrought it down to the close of the last preceding chapter\\n\\nbusiness had taken herbert on a journey to marseilles i was alone and\\nhad a dull sense of being alone dispirited and anxious long hoping\\nthat tomorrow or next week would clear my way and long disappointed\\ni sadly missed the cheerful face and ready response of my friend\\n\\nit was wretched weather stormy and wet stormy and wet and mud mud\\nmud deep in all the streets day after day a vast heavy veil had been\\ndriving over london from the east and it drove still as if in the\\neast there were an eternity of cloud and wind so furious had been the\\ngusts that high buildings in town had had the lead stripped off their\\nroofs and in the country trees had been torn up and sails of\\nwindmills carried away and gloomy accounts had come in from the coast\\nof shipwreck and death violent blasts of rain had accompanied these\\nrages of wind and the day just closed as i sat down to read had been\\nthe worst of all\\n\\nalterations have been made in that part of the temple since that time\\nand it has not now so lonely a character as it had then nor is it so\\nexposed to the river we lived at the top of the last house and the\\nwind rushing up the river shook the house that night like discharges\\nof cannon or breakings of a sea when the rain came with it and dashed\\nagainst the windows i thought raising my eyes to them as they rocked\\nthat i might have fancied myself in a stormbeaten lighthouse\\noccasionally the smoke came rolling down the chimney as though it\\ncould not bear to go out into such a night and when i set the doors\\nopen and looked down the staircase the staircase lamps were blown out\\nand when i shaded my face with my hands and looked through the black\\nwindows opening them ever so little was out of the question in the\\nteeth of such wind and rain i saw that the lamps in the court were\\nblown out and that the lamps on the bridges and the shore were\\nshuddering and that the coalfires in barges on the river were being\\ncarried away before the wind like redhot splashes in the rain\\n\\ni read with my watch upon the table purposing to close my book at\\neleven oâ\\x80\\x99clock as i shut it saint paulâ\\x80\\x99s and all the many\\nchurchclocks in the cityâ\\x80\\x94some leading some accompanying some\\nfollowingâ\\x80\\x94struck that hour the sound was curiously flawed by the wind\\nand i was listening and thinking how the wind assailed and tore it\\nwhen i heard a footstep on the stair\\n\\nwhat nervous folly made me start and awfully connect it with the\\nfootstep of my dead sister matters not it was past in a moment and i\\nlistened again and heard the footstep stumble in coming on\\nremembering then that the staircaselights were blown out i took up\\nmy readinglamp and went out to the stairhead whoever was below had\\nstopped on seeing my lamp for all was quiet\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthere is some one down there is there notâ\\x80\\x9d i called out looking\\ndown\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyesâ\\x80\\x9d said a voice from the darkness beneath\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhat floor do you wantâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthe top mr pipâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthat is my nameâ\\x80\\x94there is nothing the matterâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnothing the matterâ\\x80\\x9d returned the voice and the man came on\\n\\ni stood with my lamp held out over the stairrail and he came slowly\\nwithin its light it was a shaded lamp to shine upon a book and its\\ncircle of light was very contracted so that he was in it for a mere\\ninstant and then out of it in the instant i had seen a face that was\\nstrange to me looking up with an incomprehensible air of being touched\\nand pleased by the sight of me\\n\\nmoving the lamp as the man moved i made out that he was substantially\\ndressed but roughly like a voyager by sea that he had long irongrey\\nhair that his age was about sixty that he was a muscular man strong\\non his legs and that he was browned and hardened by exposure to\\nweather as he ascended the last stair or two and the light of my lamp\\nincluded us both i saw with a stupid kind of amazement that he was\\nholding out both his hands to me\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cpray what is your businessâ\\x80\\x9d i asked him\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmy businessâ\\x80\\x9d he repeated pausing â\\x80\\x9cah yes i will explain my\\nbusiness by your leaveâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cdo you wish to come inâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyesâ\\x80\\x9d he replied â\\x80\\x9ci wish to come in masterâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni had asked him the question inhospitably enough for i resented the\\nsort of bright and gratified recognition that still shone in his face\\ni resented it because it seemed to imply that he expected me to\\nrespond to it but i took him into the room i had just left and\\nhaving set the lamp on the table asked him as civilly as i could to\\nexplain himself\\n\\nhe looked about him with the strangest airâ\\x80\\x94an air of wondering\\npleasure as if he had some part in the things he admiredâ\\x80\\x94and he\\npulled off a rough outer coat and his hat then i saw that his head\\nwas furrowed and bald and that the long irongrey hair grew only on\\nits sides but i saw nothing that in the least explained him on the\\ncontrary i saw him next moment once more holding out both his hands\\nto me\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhat do you meanâ\\x80\\x9d said i half suspecting him to be mad\\n\\nhe stopped in his looking at me and slowly rubbed his right hand over\\nhis head â\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s disapinting to a manâ\\x80\\x9d he said in a coarse broken\\nvoice â\\x80\\x9carter having looked forâ\\x80\\x99ard so distant and come so fur but\\nyouâ\\x80\\x99re not to blame for thatâ\\x80\\x94neither on us is to blame for that iâ\\x80\\x99ll\\nspeak in half a minute give me half a minute pleaseâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nhe sat down on a chair that stood before the fire and covered his\\nforehead with his large brown veinous hands i looked at him\\nattentively then and recoiled a little from him but i did not know\\nhim\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthereâ\\x80\\x99s no one nighâ\\x80\\x9d said he looking over his shoulder â\\x80\\x9cis thereâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhy do you a stranger coming into my rooms at this time of the night\\nask that questionâ\\x80\\x9d said i\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyouâ\\x80\\x99re a game oneâ\\x80\\x9d he returned shaking his head at me with a\\ndeliberate affection at once most unintelligible and most\\nexasperating

the intention he had detected for i knew him even yet\\ni could not recall a single feature but i knew him if the wind and\\nthe rain had driven away the intervening years had scattered all the\\nintervening objects had swept us to the churchyard where we first\\nstood face to face on such different levels i could not have known my\\nconvict more distinctly than i knew him now as he sat in the chair\\nbefore the fire no need to take a file from his pocket and show it to\\nme no need to take the handkerchief from his neck and twist it round\\nhis head no need to hug himself with both his arms and take a\\nshivering turn across the room looking back at me for recognition i\\nknew him before he gave me one of those aids though a moment before\\ni had not been conscious of remotely suspecting his identity\\n\\nhe came back to where i stood and again held out both his hands not\\nknowing what to doâ\\x80\\x94for in my astonishment i had lost my\\nselfpossessionâ\\x80\\x94i reluctantly gave him my hands he grasped them\\nheartily raised them to his lips kissed them and still held them\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou acted noble my boyâ\\x80\\x9d said he â\\x80\\x9cnoble pip and i have never\\nforgot itâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nat a change in his manner as if he were even going to embrace me i\\nlaid a hand upon his breast and put him away\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cstayâ\\x80\\x9d said i â\\x80\\x9ckeep off if you are grateful to me for what i did\\nwhen i was a little child i hope you have shown your gratitude by\\nmending your way of life if you have come here to thank me it was not\\nnecessary still however you have found me out there must be\\nsomething good in the feeling that has brought you here and i will not\\nrepulse you but surely you must understand thatâ\\x80\\x94iâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nmy attention was so attracted by the singularity of his fixed look at\\nme that the words died away on my tongue\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou was asayingâ\\x80\\x9d he observed when we had confronted one another in\\nsilence â\\x80\\x9cthat surely i must understand what surely must i\\nunderstandâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthat i cannot wish to renew that chance intercourse with you of long\\nago under these different circumstances i am glad to believe you have\\nrepented and recovered yourself i am glad to tell you so i am glad\\nthat thinking i deserve to be thanked you have come to thank me but\\nour ways are different ways none the less you are wet and you look\\nweary will you drink something before you goâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nhe had replaced his neckerchief loosely and had stood keenly\\nobservant of me biting a long end of it â\\x80\\x9ci thinkâ\\x80\\x9d he answered still\\nwith the end at his mouth and still observant of me â\\x80\\x9cthat i will\\ndrink i thank you afore i goâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthere was a tray ready on a sidetable i brought it to the table near\\nthe fire and asked him what he would have he touched one of the\\nbottles without looking at it or speaking and i made him some hot rum\\nand water i tried to keep my hand steady while i did so but his look\\nat me as he leaned back in his chair with the long draggled end of his\\nneckerchief between his teethâ\\x80\\x94evidently forgottenâ\\x80\\x94made my hand very\\ndifficult to master when at last i put the glass to him i saw with\\namazement that his eyes were full of tears\\n\\nup to this time i had remained standing not to disguise that i wished\\nhim gone but i was softened by the softened aspect of the man and\\nfelt a touch of reproach â\\x80\\x9ci hopeâ\\x80\\x9d said i hurriedly putting something\\ninto a glass for myself and drawing a chair to the table â\\x80\\x9cthat you\\nwill not think i spoke harshly to you just now i had no intention of\\ndoing it and i am sorry for it if i did i wish you well and happyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nas i put my glass to my lips he glanced with surprise at the end of\\nhis neckerchief dropping from his mouth when he opened it and\\nstretched out his hand i gave him mine and then he drank and drew\\nhis sleeve across his eyes and forehead\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9chow are you livingâ\\x80\\x9d i asked

other folded them\\nlongwise gave them a twist set fire to them at the lamp and dropped\\nthe ashes into the tray\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmay i make so boldâ\\x80\\x9d he said then with a smile that was like

a foot up to the bars\\nto dry and warm it and the wet boot began to steam but he neither\\nlooked at it nor at the fire but steadily looked at me it was only\\nnow that i began to tremble\\n\\nwhen my lips had parted and had shaped some words that were without\\nsound i forced myself to tell him though i could not do it\\ndistinctly that i had been chosen to succeed to some property\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmight a mere warmint ask what propertyâ\\x80\\x9d said he\\n\\ni faltered â\\x80\\x9ci donâ\\x80\\x99t knowâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmight a mere warmint ask whose

silent\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhere will you put meâ\\x80\\x9d he asked presently â\\x80\\x9ci must be put\\nsomewheres dear boyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cto sleepâ\\x80\\x9d said i\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyes and

i should of a certainty be hanged if\\ntookâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nnothing was needed but this the wretched man after loading wretched\\nme with his gold and silver chains for years had risked his life to\\ncome to me and i held it there in my keeping if i had loved him\\ninstead of abhorring him if i had been attracted to him by the\\nstrongest admiration and affection instead of shrinking from him with\\nthe strongest repugnance it could have been no worse on the contrary\\nit would have been better for his preservation would then have\\nnaturally and tenderly addressed my heart\\n\\nmy first care was to close the shutters so that no light might be seen\\nfrom without and then to close and make fast the doors while i did\\nso he stood at the table drinking rum and eating biscuit and when i\\nsaw him thus engaged i saw my convict on the marshes at his meal\\nagain it almost seemed to me as if he must stoop down presently to\\nfile at his leg\\n\\nwhen i had gone into herbertâ\\x80\\x99s room and had shut off any other\\ncommunication between it and the staircase than through the room in\\nwhich our conversation had been held i asked him if he would go to\\nbed he said yes but asked me for some of my â\\x80\\x9cgentlemanâ\\x80\\x99s linenâ\\x80\\x9d to\\nput on in the morning i brought it out and laid it ready for him and\\nmy blood again ran cold when he again took me by both hands to give me\\ngoodnight\\n\\ni got away from him without knowing how i did it and mended the fire\\nin the room where we had been together and sat down by it afraid to\\ngo to bed for an hour or more i remained too stunned to think and it\\nwas not until i began to think that i began fully to know how wrecked\\ni was and how the ship in which i had sailed was gone to pieces\\n\\nmiss havishamâ\\x80\\x99s intentions towards me all a mere dream estella not\\ndesigned for me i only suffered in satis house as a convenience a\\nsting for the greedy relations a model with a mechanical heart to\\npractise on when no other practice was at hand those were the first\\nsmarts i had but sharpest and deepest pain of allâ\\x80\\x94it was for the\\nconvict guilty of i knew not what crimes and liable to be taken out\\nof those rooms where i sat thinking and hanged at the old bailey door\\nthat i had deserted joe\\n\\ni would not have gone back to joe now i would not have gone back to\\nbiddy now for any consideration simply i suppose because my sense\\nof my own worthless conduct to them was greater than every\\nconsideration no wisdom on earth could have given me the comfort that\\ni should have derived from their simplicity and fidelity but i could\\nnever never undo what i had done\\n\\nin every rage of wind and rush of rain i heard pursuers twice i\\ncould have sworn there was a knocking and whispering at the outer door\\nwith these fears upon me i began either to imagine or recall that i\\nhad had mysterious warnings of this manâ\\x80\\x99s approach that for weeks\\ngone by i had passed faces in the streets which i had thought like\\nhis that these likenesses had grown more numerous as he coming over\\nthe sea had drawn nearer that his wicked spirit had somehow sent\\nthese messengers to mine and that now on this stormy night he was as\\ngood as his word and with me\\n\\ncrowding up with these reflections came the reflection that i had seen\\nhim with my childish eyes to be a desperately violent man that i had\\nheard that other convict reiterate that he had tried to murder him\\nthat i had seen him down in the ditch tearing and fighting like a wild\\nbeast out of such remembrances i brought into the light of the fire a\\nhalfformed terror that it might not be safe to be shut up there with\\nhim in the dead of the wild solitary night this dilated until it\\nfilled the room and impelled me to take a candle and go in and look at\\nmy dreadful burden\\n\\nhe had rolled a handkerchief round his head and his face was set and\\nlowering in his sleep but he was asleep and quietly too though he\\nhad a pistol lying on the pillow assured of this i softly removed the\\nkey to the outside of his door and turned it on him before i again sat\\ndown by the fire gradually i slipped from the chair and lay on the\\nfloor when i awoke without having parted in my sleep with the\\nperception of my wretchedness the clocks of the eastward churches were\\nstriking five the candles were wasted out the fire was dead and the\\nwind and rain intensified the thick black darkness\\n\\nthis is the end of the second stage of pipâ\\x80\\x99s expectations\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter xl\\n\\n\\nit was fortunate for me that i had to take precautions to ensure so\\nfar as i could the safety of my dreaded visitor for this thought\\npressing on me when i awoke held other thoughts in a confused\\nconcourse at a distance\\n\\nthe impossibility of keeping him concealed in the chambers was\\nselfevident it could not be done and the attempt to do it would\\ninevitably engender suspicion true i had no avenger in my service\\nnow but i was looked after by an inflammatory old female assisted by\\nan animated ragbag whom she called her niece and to keep a room\\nsecret from them would be to invite curiosity and exaggeration they\\nboth had weak eyes which i had long attributed to their chronically\\nlooking in at keyholes and they were always at hand when not wanted\\nindeed that was their only reliable quality besides larceny not to get\\nup a mystery with these people i resolved to announce in the morning\\nthat my uncle had unexpectedly come from the country\\n\\nthis course i decided on while i was yet groping about in the darkness\\nfor the means of getting a light not stumbling on the means after all\\ni was fain to go out to the adjacent lodge and get the watchman there\\nto come with his lantern now in groping my way down the black\\nstaircase i fell over something and that something was a man crouching\\nin a corner\\n\\nas the man made no answer when i asked him what he did there but\\neluded my touch in silence i ran to the lodge and urged the watchman\\nto come quickly telling him of the incident on the way back the wind\\nbeing as fierce as ever we did not care to endanger the light in the\\nlantern by rekindling the extinguished lamps on the staircase but we\\nexamined the staircase from the bottom to the top and found no one\\nthere it then occurred to me as possible that the man might have\\nslipped into my rooms so lighting my candle at the watchmanâ\\x80\\x99s and\\nleaving him standing at the door i examined them carefully including\\nthe room in which my dreaded guest lay asleep all was quiet and\\nassuredly no other man was in those chambers\\n\\nit troubled me that there should have been a lurker on the stairs on\\nthat night of all nights in the year and i asked the watchman on the\\nchance of eliciting some hopeful explanation as i handed him a dram at\\nthe door whether he had admitted at his gate any gentleman who had\\nperceptibly been dining out yes he said at different times of the\\nnight three one lived in fountain court and the other two lived in\\nthe lane and he had seen them all go home again the only other man\\nwho dwelt in the house of which my chambers formed a part had been in\\nthe country for some weeks and he certainly had not returned in the\\nnight because we had seen his door with his seal on it as we came\\nupstairs\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthe night being so bad sirâ\\x80\\x9d said the watchman as he gave me back my\\nglass â\\x80\\x9cuncommon few have come in at my gate besides them three\\ngentlemen that i have named i donâ\\x80\\x99t call to mind another since about\\neleven oâ\\x80\\x99clock when a stranger asked for youâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmy uncleâ\\x80\\x9d i muttered â\\x80\\x9cyesâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou saw him sirâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyes oh yesâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9clikewise the person with himâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cperson with himâ\\x80\\x9d i repeated\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci judged the person to be with himâ\\x80\\x9d returned the watchman â\\x80\\x9cthe\\nperson stopped when he stopped to make inquiry of me and the person\\ntook this way when he took this wayâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhat sort of personâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthe watchman had not particularly noticed he should say a working\\nperson to the best of his belief he had a dustcoloured kind of\\nclothes on under a dark coat the watchman made more light of the\\nmatter than i did and naturally not having my reason for attaching\\nweight to it\\n\\nwhen i had got rid of him which i thought it well to do without\\nprolonging explanations my mind was much troubled by these two\\ncircumstances taken together whereas they were easy of innocent\\nsolution apartâ\\x80\\x94as for instance some diner out or diner at home who\\nhad not gone near this watchmanâ\\x80\\x99s gate might have strayed to my\\nstaircase and dropped asleep thereâ\\x80\\x94and my nameless visitor might have\\nbrought some one with him to show him the wayâ\\x80\\x94still joined they had\\nan ugly look to one as prone to distrust and fear as the changes of a\\nfew hours had made me\\n\\ni lighted my fire which burnt with a raw pale flare at that time of\\nthe morning and fell into a doze before it i seemed to have been\\ndozing a whole night when the clocks struck six as there was full an\\nhour and a half between me and daylight i dozed again now waking up\\nuneasily with prolix conversations about nothing in my ears now\\nmaking thunder of the wind in the chimney at length falling off into\\na profound sleep from which the daylight woke me with a start\\n\\nall this time i had never been able to consider my own situation nor\\ncould i do so yet i had not the power to attend to it i was greatly\\ndejected and distressed but in an incoherent wholesale sort of way as\\nto forming any plan for the future i could as soon have formed an\\nelephant when i opened the shutters and looked out at the wet wild\\nmorning all of a leaden hue when i walked from room to room when i\\nsat down again shivering before the fire waiting for my laundress to\\nappear i thought how miserable i was but hardly knew why or how long\\ni had been so or on what day of the week i made the reflection or\\neven who i was that made it\\n\\nat last the old woman and the niece came inâ\\x80\\x94the latter with a head\\nnot easily distinguishable from her dusty broomâ\\x80\\x94and testified surprise\\nat sight of me and the fire to whom i imparted how my uncle had come\\nin the night and was then asleep and how the breakfast preparations\\nwere to be modified accordingly then i washed and dressed while they\\nknocked the furniture about and made a dust and so in a sort of dream\\nor sleepwaking i found myself sitting by the fire again waiting\\nforâ\\x80\\x94himâ\\x80\\x94to come to breakfast\\n\\nby and by his door opened and he came out i could not bring myself to\\nbear the sight of him and i thought he had a worse look by daylight\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci do not even knowâ\\x80\\x9d said i speaking low as he took his seat at the\\ntable â\\x80\\x9cby what name to call you i have given out that you are my\\nuncleâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthatâ\\x80\\x99s it dear boy call me uncleâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou assumed some name i suppose on board shipâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyes dear boy i took the name of provisâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cdo you mean to keep that nameâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhy yes dear boy itâ\\x80\\x99s as good as anotherâ\\x80\\x94unless youâ\\x80\\x99d like\\nanotherâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhat is your real nameâ\\x80\\x9d i asked him in a whisper\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmagwitchâ\\x80\\x9d he answered in the same tone â\\x80\\x9cchrisenâ\\x80\\x99d abelâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhat were you brought up to beâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ca warmint dear boyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nhe answered quite seriously and used the word as if it denoted some\\nprofession\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhen you came into the temple last nightâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d said i pausing to wonder\\nwhether that could really have been last night which seemed so long\\nago\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyes dear boyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhen you came in at the gate and asked the watchman the way here had\\nyou any one with youâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwith me no dear boyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbut there was some one thereâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci didnâ\\x80\\x99t take particular noticeâ\\x80\\x9d he said dubiously â\\x80\\x9cnot knowing the\\nways of the place but i think there was a person too come in\\nalonger meâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9care you known in londonâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci hope notâ\\x80\\x9d said he giving his neck a jerk with his forefinger that\\nmade me turn hot and sick\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwere you known in london onceâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnot over and above dear boy i was in the provinces mostlyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwere youâ\\x80\\x94triedâ\\x80\\x94in londonâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhich timeâ\\x80\\x9d said he with a sharp look\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthe last timeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nhe nodded â\\x80\\x9cfirst knowed mr jaggers that way jaggers was for meâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nit was on my lips to ask him what he was tried for but he took up a\\nknife gave it a flourish and with the words â\\x80\\x9cand what i done is\\nworked out and paid forâ\\x80\\x9d fell to at his breakfast\\n\\nhe ate in a ravenous way that was very disagreeable and all his\\nactions were uncouth noisy and greedy some of his teeth had failed\\nhim since i saw him eat on the marshes and as he turned his food in\\nhis mouth and turned his head sideways to bring his strongest fangs to\\nbear upon it he looked terribly like a hungry old dog if i had begun\\nwith any appetite he would have taken it away and i should have sat\\nmuch as i didâ\\x80\\x94repelled from him by an insurmountable aversion and\\ngloomily looking at the cloth\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ciâ\\x80\\x99m a heavy grubber dear boyâ\\x80\\x9d he said as a polite kind of apology\\nwhen he made an end of his meal â\\x80\\x9cbut i always was if it had been in\\nmy constitution to be a lighter grubber i might haâ\\x80\\x99 got into lighter\\ntrouble similarly i must have my smoke when i was first hired out as\\nshepherd tâ\\x80\\x99other side the world itâ\\x80\\x99s my belief i should haâ\\x80\\x99 turned\\ninto a molloncollymad sheep myself if i hadnâ\\x80\\x99t a had my smokeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nas he said so he got up from table and putting his hand into the\\nbreast of the peacoat he wore brought out a short black pipe and a\\nhandful of loose tobacco of the kind that is called negrohead having\\nfilled his pipe he put the surplus tobacco back again as if his\\npocket were a drawer then he took a live coal from the fire with the\\ntongs and lighted his pipe at it and then turned round on the\\nhearthrug with his back to the fire and went through his favourite\\naction of holding out both his hands for mine\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cand thisâ\\x80\\x9d said he dandling my hands up and down in his as he puffed\\nat his pipeâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cand this is the gentleman what i made the real genuine\\none it does me good fur to look at you pip all i stipâ\\x80\\x99late is to\\nstand by and look at you dear boyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni released my hands as soon as i could and found that i was beginning\\nslowly to settle down to the contemplation of my condition what i was\\nchained to and how heavily became intelligible to me as i heard his\\nhoarse voice and sat looking up at his furrowed bald head with its\\niron grey hair at the sides\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci mustnâ\\x80\\x99t see my gentleman a footing it in the mire of the streets\\nthere mustnâ\\x80\\x99t be no mud on his boots my gentleman must have horses\\npip horses to ride and horses to drive and horses for his servant to\\nride and drive as well shall colonists have their horses and blood\\nâ\\x80\\x99uns if you please good lord and not my london gentleman no no\\nweâ\\x80\\x99ll show â\\x80\\x99em another pair of shoes than that pip wonâ\\x80\\x99t usâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nhe took out of his pocket a great thick pocketbook bursting with\\npapers and tossed it on the table\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthereâ\\x80\\x99s something worth spending in that there book dear boy itâ\\x80\\x99s\\nyourn all iâ\\x80\\x99ve got

money like a gentleman thatâ\\x80\\x99ll be my\\npleasure my pleasure â\\x80\\x99ull be fur to see him do it and blast you\\nallâ\\x80\\x9d he wound up looking round the room and snapping his fingers once\\nwith a loud snap â\\x80\\x9cblast you every one from the judge in his wig to\\nthe colonist a stirring up the dust iâ\\x80\\x99ll show a better gentleman than\\nthe whole kit on you put togetherâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cstopâ\\x80\\x9d said i almost in a frenzy of fear and dislike â\\x80\\x9ci want to\\nspeak to you i want to know what is to be done i want to know how you\\nare to be kept out of danger how long you are going to stay what\\nprojects you haveâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9clookâ\\x80\\x99ee here pipâ\\x80\\x9d said he laying his hand on my arm in a suddenly\\naltered and subdued manner â\\x80\\x9cfirst of all lookâ\\x80\\x99ee here i forgot\\nmyself half a minute ago what i said was low thatâ\\x80\\x99s what it was low\\nlookâ\\x80\\x99ee here pip look over it i

i swear it is deathâ\\x80\\x9d said he putting his pipe back in his\\nmouth â\\x80\\x9cand death by the rope in the open street not fur from this\\nand itâ\\x80\\x99s serious that you should fully understand it to be so what\\nthen when thatâ\\x80\\x99s once done here i am to go back now â\\x80\\x99ud be as bad as\\nto stand groundâ\\x80\\x94worse besides pip iâ\\x80\\x99m here because iâ\\x80\\x99ve meant it by\\nyou years and years as to what i dare iâ\\x80\\x99m a old bird now as has\\ndared all manner of traps since first he was fledged and iâ\\x80\\x99m not\\nafeerd to perch upon a scarecrow if thereâ\\x80\\x99s death hid inside of it\\nthere is and let him come out and iâ\\x80\\x99ll face him and then iâ\\x80\\x99ll\\nbelieve in him and not afore and now let me have a look at my\\ngentleman agenâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nonce more he took me by both hands and surveyed me with an air of\\nadmiring proprietorship smoking with great complacency all the while\\n\\nit appeared to me that i could do no better than secure him some quiet\\nlodging hard by of which he might take possession when herbert\\nreturned whom i expected in two or three days that the secret must be\\nconfided to herbert as a matter of unavoidable necessity even if i\\ncould have put the immense relief i should derive from sharing it with\\nhim out of the question was plain to me but it was by no means so\\nplain to mr provis i resolved to call him by that name who reserved\\nhis consent to herbertâ\\x80\\x99s participation until he should have seen him\\nand formed a favourable judgment of his physiognomy â\\x80\\x9cand even then\\ndear boyâ\\x80\\x9d said he pulling a greasy little clasped black testament out\\nof his pocket â\\x80\\x9cweâ\\x80\\x99ll have him on his oathâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nto state that my terrible patron carried this little black book about\\nthe world solely to swear people on in cases of emergency would be to\\nstate what i never quite established but this i can say that i never\\nknew him put it to any other use the book itself had the appearance of\\nhaving been stolen from some court of justice and perhaps his\\nknowledge of its antecedents combined with his own experience in that\\nwise gave him a reliance on its powers as a sort of legal spell or\\ncharm on this first occasion of his producing it i recalled how he\\nhad made me swear fidelity in the churchyard long ago and how he had\\ndescribed himself last night as always swearing to his resolutions in\\nhis solitude\\n\\nas he was at present dressed in a seafaring slop suit in which he\\nlooked as if he had some parrots and cigars to dispose of i next\\ndiscussed with him what dress he should wear he cherished an\\nextraordinary belief in the virtues of â\\x80\\x9cshortsâ\\x80\\x9d as a disguise and had\\nin his own mind sketched a dress for himself that would have made him\\nsomething between a dean and a dentist it was with considerable\\ndifficulty that i won him over to the assumption of a dress more like a\\nprosperous farmerâ\\x80\\x99s and we arranged that he should cut his hair close\\nand wear a little powder lastly as he had not yet been seen by the\\nlaundress or her niece he was to keep himself out of their view until\\nhis change of dress was made\\n\\nit would seem a simple matter to decide on these precautions but in my\\ndazed not to say distracted state it took so long that i did not\\nget out to further them until two or three in the afternoon he was to\\nremain shut up in the chambers while i was gone and was on no account\\nto open the door\\n\\nthere being to my knowledge a respectable lodginghouse in essex\\nstreet the back of which looked into the temple and was almost within\\nhail of my windows i first of all repaired to that house and was so\\nfortunate as to secure the second floor for my uncle mr provis i\\nthen went from shop to shop making such purchases as were necessary to\\nthe change in his appearance this business transacted i turned my\\nface on my own account to little britain mr jaggers was at his\\ndesk but seeing me enter got up immediately and stood before his\\nfire\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnow pipâ\\x80\\x9d said he â\\x80\\x9cbe carefulâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci will sirâ\\x80\\x9d i returned for coming along i had thought well of what\\ni was going to say\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cdonâ\\x80\\x99t commit yourselfâ\\x80\\x9d said mr jaggers â\\x80\\x9cand donâ\\x80\\x99t commit any one\\nyou understandâ\\x80\\x94any one donâ\\x80\\x99t tell me anything i donâ\\x80\\x99t want to know\\nanything i am not curiousâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nof course i saw that he knew the man was come\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci merely want mr jaggersâ\\x80\\x9d said i â\\x80\\x9cto assure myself that what i\\nhave been told is true i have no hope of its being untrue but at\\nleast i may verify itâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nmr jaggers nodded â\\x80\\x9cbut did you say â\\x80\\x98toldâ\\x80\\x99 or â\\x80\\x98informedâ\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d he asked\\nme with his head on one side and not looking at me but looking in a\\nlistening way at the floor â\\x80\\x9ctold would seem to imply verbal\\ncommunication you canâ\\x80\\x99t have verbal communication with a man in new\\nsouth wales you knowâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci will say informed mr jaggersâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cgoodâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci have been informed by a person named abel magwitch that he is the\\nbenefactor so long unknown to meâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthat is the manâ\\x80\\x9d said mr jaggers â\\x80\\x9cin new south walesâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cand only heâ\\x80\\x9d said i\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cand only heâ\\x80\\x9d said mr jaggers\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci am not so unreasonable sir as to think you at all responsible for\\nmy mistakes and wrong conclusions but i always supposed it was miss\\nhavishamâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cas you say pipâ\\x80\\x9d returned mr jaggers turning his eyes upon me\\ncoolly and taking a bite at his forefinger â\\x80\\x9ci am not at all\\nresponsible for thatâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cand yet it looked so like it sirâ\\x80\\x9d i pleaded with a downcast heart\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnot a particle of evidence pipâ\\x80\\x9d said mr jaggers shaking his head\\nand gathering up his skirts â\\x80\\x9ctake nothing on its looks take\\neverything on evidence thereâ\\x80\\x99s no better ruleâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci have no more to sayâ\\x80\\x9d said i with a sigh after standing silent for\\na little while â\\x80\\x9ci have verified my information and thereâ\\x80\\x99s an endâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cand magwitchâ\\x80\\x94in new south walesâ\\x80\\x94having at last disclosed himselfâ\\x80\\x9d\\nsaid mr jaggers â\\x80\\x9cyou will comprehend pip how rigidly throughout my\\ncommunication with you i have always adhered to the strict line of\\nfact there has never been the least departure from the strict line of\\nfact you are quite aware of thatâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cquite sirâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci communicated to magwitchâ\\x80\\x94in new south walesâ\\x80\\x94when he first wrote to\\nmeâ\\x80\\x94from new south walesâ\\x80\\x94the caution that he must not expect me ever to\\ndeviate from the strict line of fact i also communicated to him\\nanother caution he appeared to me to have obscurely hinted in his\\nletter at some distant idea he had of seeing you in england here i\\ncautioned him that i must hear no more of that that he was not at all\\nlikely to obtain a pardon that he was expatriated for the term of his\\nnatural life and that his presenting himself in this country would be\\nan act of felony rendering him liable to the extreme penalty of the\\nlaw i gave magwitch that cautionâ\\x80\\x9d said mr jaggers looking hard at\\nme â\\x80\\x9ci wrote it to new south wales he guided himself by it no doubtâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cno doubtâ\\x80\\x9d said i\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci have been informed by wemmickâ\\x80\\x9d pursued mr jaggers still looking\\nhard at me â\\x80\\x9cthat he has received a letter under date portsmouth from\\na colonist of the name of purvis orâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cor provisâ\\x80\\x9d i suggested\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cor provisâ\\x80\\x94thank you pip perhaps it is provis perhaps you know\\nitâ\\x80\\x99s provisâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyesâ\\x80\\x9d said i\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou know itâ\\x80\\x99s provis a letter under date portsmouth from a colonist\\nof the name of provis asking for the particulars of your address on\\nbehalf of magwitch wemmick sent him the particulars i understand by\\nreturn of post probably it is through provis that you have received\\nthe explanation of magwitchâ\\x80\\x94in new south walesâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cit came through provisâ\\x80\\x9d i replied\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cgood day pipâ\\x80\\x9d said mr jaggers offering his hand â\\x80\\x9cglad to have\\nseen you in writing by post to magwitchâ\\x80\\x94in new south walesâ\\x80\\x94or in\\ncommunicating with him through provis have the goodness to mention\\nthat the particulars and vouchers of our long account shall be sent to\\nyou together with the balance for there is still a balance remaining\\ngoodday pipâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nwe shook hands and he looked hard at me as long as he could see me i\\nturned at the door and he was still looking hard at me while the two\\nvile casts on the shelf seemed to be trying to get their eyelids open\\nand to force out of their swollen throats â\\x80\\x9co what a man he isâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nwemmick was out and though he had been at his desk he could have done\\nnothing for me i went straight back to the temple where i found the\\nterrible provis drinking rum and water and smoking negrohead in\\nsafety\\n\\nnext day the clothes i had ordered all came home and he put them on\\nwhatever he put on became him less it dismally seemed to me than\\nwhat he had worn before to my thinking there was something in him\\nthat made it hopeless to attempt to disguise him the more i dressed\\nhim and the better i dressed him the more he looked like the slouching\\nfugitive on the marshes this effect on my anxious fancy was partly\\nreferable no doubt to his old face and manner growing more familiar\\nto me but i believe too that he dragged one of his legs as if there\\nwere still a weight of iron on it and that from head to foot there was\\nconvict in the very grain of the man\\n\\nthe influences of his solitary hutlife were upon him besides and gave\\nhim a savage air that no dress could tame added to these were the\\ninfluences of his subsequent branded life among men and crowning all\\nhis consciousness that he was dodging and hiding now in all his ways\\nof sitting and standing and eating and drinkingâ\\x80\\x94of brooding about in\\na highshouldered reluctant styleâ\\x80\\x94of taking out his great hornhandled\\njackknife and wiping it on his legs and cutting his foodâ\\x80\\x94of lifting\\nlight glasses and cups to his lips as if they were clumsy\\npannikinsâ\\x80\\x94of chopping a wedge off his bread and soaking up with it\\nthe last fragments of gravy round and round his plate as if to make\\nthe most of an allowance and then drying his fingerends on it and\\nthen swallowing itâ\\x80\\x94in these ways and a thousand other small nameless\\ninstances arising every minute in the day there was prisoner felon\\nbondsman plain as plain could be\\n\\nit had been his own idea to wear that touch of powder and i had\\nconceded the powder after overcoming the shorts but i can compare the\\neffect of it when on to nothing but the probable effect of rouge upon\\nthe dead so awful was the manner in which everything in him that it\\nwas most desirable to repress started through that thin layer of\\npretence and seemed to come blazing out at the crown of his head it\\nwas abandoned as soon as tried and he wore his grizzled hair cut\\nshort\\n\\nwords cannot tell what a sense i had at the same time of the dreadful\\nmystery that he was to me when he fell asleep of an evening with his\\nknotted hands clenching the sides of the easychair and his bald head\\ntattooed with deep wrinkles falling forward on his breast i would sit\\nand look at him wondering what he had done and loading him with all\\nthe crimes in the calendar until the impulse was powerful on me to\\nstart up and fly from him every hour so increased my abhorrence of\\nhim that i even think i might have yielded to this impulse in the\\nfirst agonies of being so haunted notwithstanding all he had done for\\nme and the risk he ran but for the knowledge that herbert must soon\\ncome back once i actually did start out of bed in the night and\\nbegin to dress myself in my worst clothes hurriedly intending to leave\\nhim there with everything else i possessed and enlist for india as a\\nprivate soldier\\n\\ni doubt if a ghost could have been more terrible to me up in those\\nlonely rooms in the long evenings and long nights with the wind and\\nthe rain always rushing by a ghost could not have been taken and\\nhanged on my account and the consideration that he could be and the\\ndread that he would be were no small addition to my horrors when he\\nwas not asleep or playing a complicated kind of patience with a ragged\\npack of cards of his ownâ\\x80\\x94a game that i never saw before or since and\\nin which he recorded his winnings by sticking his jackknife into the\\ntableâ\\x80\\x94when he was not engaged in either of these pursuits he would\\nask me to read to himâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cforeign language dear boyâ\\x80\\x9d while i complied\\nhe not comprehending a single word would stand before the fire\\nsurveying me with the air of an exhibitor and i would see him between\\nthe fingers of the hand with which i shaded my face appealing in dumb\\nshow to the furniture to take notice of my proficiency the imaginary\\nstudent pursued by the misshapen creature he had impiously made was\\nnot more wretched than i pursued by the creature who had made me and\\nrecoiling from him with a stronger repulsion the more he admired me\\nand the fonder he was of me\\n\\nthis is written of i am sensible as if it had lasted a year it\\nlasted about five days expecting herbert all the time i dared not go\\nout except when i took provis for an airing after dark at length one\\nevening when dinner was over and i had dropped into a slumber quite\\nworn outâ\\x80\\x94for my nights had been agitated and my rest broken by fearful\\ndreamsâ\\x80\\x94i was roused by the welcome footstep on the staircase provis\\nwho had been asleep too staggered up at the noise i made and in an\\ninstant i saw his jackknife shining in his hand\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cquiet itâ\\x80\\x99s herbertâ\\x80\\x9d i said and herbert came bursting in with the\\nairy freshness of six hundred miles of france upon him\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9chandel my dear fellow how are you and again how are you and again\\nhow are you i seem to have been gone a twelvemonth why so i must\\nhave been for you have grown quite thin and pale handel myâ\\x80\\x94halloa i\\nbeg your pardonâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nhe was stopped in his running on and in his shaking hands with me by\\nseeing provis provis regarding him with a fixed attention was slowly\\nputting up his jackknife and groping in another pocket for something\\nelse\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cherbert my dear friendâ\\x80\\x9d said i shutting the double doors while\\nherbert stood staring and wondering â\\x80\\x9csomething very strange has\\nhappened this isâ\\x80\\x94a visitor of mineâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s all right dear boyâ\\x80\\x9d said provis coming forward with his little\\nclasped black book and then addressing himself to herbert â\\x80\\x9ctake it in\\nyour right hand lord strike you dead on the spot if ever you split in\\nany way sumever kiss itâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cdo so as he wishes itâ\\x80\\x9d i said to herbert so herbert looking at me\\nwith a friendly uneasiness and amazement complied and provis\\nimmediately shaking hands with him said â\\x80\\x9cnow youâ\\x80\\x99re on your oath you\\nknow and never believe me on mine if pip shanâ\\x80\\x99t make a gentleman on\\nyouâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter xli\\n\\n\\nin vain should i attempt to describe the astonishment and disquiet of\\nherbert when he and i and provis sat down before the fire and i\\nrecounted the whole of the secret enough that i saw my own feelings\\nreflected in herbertâ\\x80\\x99s face and not least among them my repugnance\\ntowards the man who had done so much for me\\n\\nwhat would alone have set a division between that man and us if there\\nhad been no other dividing circumstance was his triumph in my story\\nsaving his troublesome sense of having been â\\x80\\x9clowâ\\x80\\x9d on one occasion since\\nhis returnâ\\x80\\x94on which point he began to hold forth to herbert the\\nmoment my revelation was finishedâ\\x80\\x94he had no perception of the\\npossibility of my finding any fault with my good fortune his boast\\nthat he had made me a gentleman and that he had come to see me support\\nthe character on his ample resources was made for me quite as much as\\nfor himself and that it was a highly agreeable boast to both of us\\nand that we must both be very proud of it was a conclusion quite\\nestablished in his own mind\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthough lookâ\\x80\\x99ee here pipâ\\x80\\x99s comradeâ\\x80\\x9d he said to herbert after having\\ndiscoursed for some time â\\x80\\x9ci know very well that once since i come\\nbackâ\\x80\\x94for half a minuteâ\\x80\\x94iâ\\x80\\x99ve been low i said to pip i knowed as i had\\nbeen low but donâ\\x80\\x99t you fret yourself on that score i ainâ\\x80\\x99t made pip a\\ngentleman and pip ainâ\\x80\\x99t agoing to make you a gentleman not fur me\\nnot to know whatâ\\x80\\x99s due to ye both dear boy and pipâ\\x80\\x99s comrade you two\\nmay count upon me always having a genteel muzzle on muzzled i have\\nbeen since that half a minute when i was betrayed into lowness muzzled\\ni am at the present time muzzled i ever will beâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nherbert said â\\x80\\x9ccertainlyâ\\x80\\x9d but looked as if there were no specific\\nconsolation in this and remained perplexed and dismayed we were\\nanxious for the time when he would go to his lodging and leave us\\ntogether but he was evidently jealous of leaving us together and sat\\nlate it was midnight before i took him round to essex street and saw\\nhim safely in at his own dark door when it closed upon him i\\nexperienced the first moment of relief i had known since the night of\\nhis arrival\\n\\nnever quite free from an uneasy remembrance of the man on the stairs i\\nhad always looked about me in taking my guest out after dark and in\\nbringing him back and i looked about me now difficult as it is in a\\nlarge city to avoid the suspicion of being watched when the mind is\\nconscious of danger in that regard i could not persuade myself that\\nany of the people within sight cared about my movements the few who\\nwere passing passed on their several ways and the street was empty\\nwhen i turned back into the temple nobody had come out at the gate\\nwith us nobody went in at the gate with me as i crossed by the\\nfountain i saw his lighted back windows looking bright and quiet and\\nwhen i stood for a few moments in the doorway of the building where i\\nlived before going up the stairs garden court was as still and\\nlifeless as the staircase was when i ascended it\\n\\nherbert received me with open arms and i had never felt before so\\nblessedly what it is to have a friend when he had spoken some sound\\nwords of sympathy and encouragement we sat down to consider the\\nquestion what was to be done\\n\\nthe chair that provis had occupied still remaining where it had\\nstoodâ\\x80\\x94for he had a barrack way with him of hanging about one spot in\\none unsettled manner and going through one round of observances with\\nhis pipe and his negrohead and his jackknife and his pack of cards\\nand what not as if it were all put down for him on a slateâ\\x80\\x94i say his\\nchair remaining where it had stood herbert unconsciously took it but\\nnext moment started out of it pushed it away and took another he had\\nno occasion to say after that that he had conceived an aversion for my\\npatron neither had i occasion to confess my own we interchanged that\\nconfidence without shaping a syllable\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhatâ\\x80\\x9d said i to herbert when he was safe in another chairâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cwhat is\\nto be doneâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmy poor dear handelâ\\x80\\x9d he replied holding his head â\\x80\\x9ci am too stunned\\nto thinkâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cso was i herbert when the blow first fell still something must be\\ndone he is intent upon various new expensesâ\\x80\\x94horses and carriages\\nand lavish appearances of all kinds he must be stopped somehowâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou mean that you canâ\\x80\\x99t acceptâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9chow can iâ\\x80\\x9d i interposed as herbert paused â\\x80\\x9cthink of him look at\\nhimâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nan involuntary shudder passed over both of us\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyet i am afraid the dreadful truth is herbert that he is attached to\\nme strongly attached to me was there ever such a fateâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmy poor dear handelâ\\x80\\x9d herbert repeated\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthenâ\\x80\\x9d said i â\\x80\\x9cafter all stopping short here never taking another\\npenny from him think what i owe him already then again i am heavily\\nin debtâ\\x80\\x94very heavily for me who have now no expectationsâ\\x80\\x94and i have\\nbeen bred to no calling and i am fit for nothingâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwell well wellâ\\x80\\x9d herbert remonstrated â\\x80\\x9cdonâ\\x80\\x99t say fit for nothingâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhat am i fit for i know only one thing that i am fit for and that\\nis to go for a soldier and i might have gone my dear herbert but\\nfor the prospect of taking counsel with your friendship and affectionâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nof course i broke down there and of course herbert beyond seizing a\\nwarm grip of my hand pretended not to know it\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9canyhow my dear handelâ\\x80\\x9d said he presently â\\x80\\x9csoldiering wonâ\\x80\\x99t do if\\nyou were to renounce this patronage and these favours i suppose you\\nwould do so with some faint hope of one day repaying what you have\\nalready had not very strong that hope if you went soldiering\\nbesides itâ\\x80\\x99s absurd you would be infinitely better in clarrikerâ\\x80\\x99s\\nhouse small as it is i am working up towards a partnership you\\nknowâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\npoor fellow he little suspected with whose money\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbut there is another questionâ\\x80\\x9d said herbert â\\x80\\x9cthis is an ignorant\\ndetermined man who has long had one fixed idea more than that he\\nseems to me i may misjudge him to be a man of a desperate and fierce\\ncharacterâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci know he isâ\\x80\\x9d i returned â\\x80\\x9clet me tell you what evidence i have seen\\nof itâ\\x80\\x9d and i told him what i had not mentioned in my narrative of\\nthat encounter with the other convict\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9csee thenâ\\x80\\x9d said herbert â\\x80\\x9cthink of this he comes here at the peril\\nof his life for the realisation of his fixed idea in the moment of\\nrealisation after all his toil and waiting you cut the ground from\\nunder his feet destroy his idea and make his gains worthless to him\\ndo you see nothing that he might do under the disappointmentâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci have seen it herbert and dreamed of it ever since the fatal night\\nof his arrival nothing has been in my thoughts so distinctly as his\\nputting himself in the way of being takenâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthen you may rely upon itâ\\x80\\x9d said herbert â\\x80\\x9cthat there would be great\\ndanger of his doing it that is his power over you as long as he\\nremains in england and that would be his reckless course if you\\nforsook himâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni was so struck by the horror of this idea which had weighed upon me\\nfrom the first and the working out of which would make me regard\\nmyself in some sort as his murderer that i could not rest in my\\nchair but began pacing to and fro i said to herbert meanwhile that\\neven if provis were recognised and taken in spite of himself i should\\nbe wretched as the cause however innocently yes even though i was so\\nwretched in having him at large and near me and even though i would\\nfar rather have worked at the forge all the days of my life than i\\nwould ever have come to this\\n\\nbut there was no staving off the question what was to be done\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthe first and the main thing to be doneâ\\x80\\x9d said herbert â\\x80\\x9cis to get him\\nout of england you will have to go with him and then he may be\\ninduced to goâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbut get him where i will could i prevent his coming backâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmy good handel is it not obvious that with newgate in the next\\nstreet there must be far greater hazard in your breaking your mind to\\nhim and making him reckless here than elsewhere if a pretext to get\\nhim away could be made out of that other convict or out of anything\\nelse in his life nowâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthere againâ\\x80\\x9d said i stopping before herbert with my open hands\\nheld out as if they contained the desperation of the case â\\x80\\x9ci know\\nnothing of his life it has almost made me mad to sit here of a night\\nand see him before me so bound up with my fortunes and misfortunes\\nand yet so unknown to me except as the miserable wretch who terrified\\nme two days in my childhoodâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nherbert got up and linked his arm in mine and we slowly walked to and\\nfro together studying the carpet\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9chandelâ\\x80\\x9d said herbert stopping â\\x80\\x9cyou feel convinced that you can take\\nno further benefits from him do youâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cfully surely you would too if you were in my placeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cand you feel convinced that you must break with himâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cherbert can you ask meâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cand you have and are bound to have that tenderness for the life he\\nhas risked on your account that you must save him if possible from\\nthrowing it away then you must get him out of england before you stir\\na finger to extricate yourself that done extricate yourself in\\nheavenâ\\x80\\x99s name and weâ\\x80\\x99ll see it out together dear old boyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nit was a comfort to shake hands upon it and walk up and down again\\nwith only that done\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnow herbertâ\\x80\\x9d said i â\\x80\\x9cwith reference to gaining some knowledge of\\nhis history there is but one way that i know of i must ask him point\\nblankâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyes ask himâ\\x80\\x9d said herbert â\\x80\\x9cwhen we sit at breakfast in the\\nmorningâ\\x80\\x9d for he had said on taking leave of herbert that he would\\ncome to breakfast with us\\n\\nwith this project formed we went to bed i had the wildest dreams\\nconcerning him and woke unrefreshed i woke too to recover the fear\\nwhich i had lost in the night of his being found out as a returned\\ntransport waking i never lost that fear\\n\\nhe came round at the appointed time took out his jackknife and sat\\ndown to his meal he was full of plans â\\x80\\x9cfor his gentlemanâ\\x80\\x99s coming out\\nstrong and like a gentlemanâ\\x80\\x9d and urged me to begin speedily upon the\\npocketbook which he had left in my possession he considered the\\nchambers and his own lodging as temporary residences and advised me to\\nlook out at once for a â\\x80\\x9cfashionable cribâ\\x80\\x9d near hyde park in which he\\ncould have â\\x80\\x9ca shakedownâ\\x80\\x9d when he had made an end of his breakfast\\nand was wiping his knife on his leg i said to him without a word of\\nprefaceâ\\x80\\x94\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cafter you were gone last night i told my friend of the struggle that\\nthe soldiers found you engaged in on the marshes when we came up you\\nrememberâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9crememberâ\\x80\\x9d said he â\\x80\\x9ci think soâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwe want to know something about that manâ\\x80\\x94and about you it is strange\\nto know no more about either and particularly you than i was able to\\ntell last night is not this as good a time as another for our knowing\\nmoreâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwellâ\\x80\\x9d he said after consideration â\\x80\\x9cyouâ\\x80\\x99re on your oath you know\\npipâ\\x80\\x99s comradeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cassuredlyâ\\x80\\x9d replied herbert\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cas to anything i say you knowâ\\x80\\x9d he insisted â\\x80\\x9cthe oath applies to\\nallâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci understand it to do soâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cand lookâ\\x80\\x99ee here wotever i done is worked out and paid forâ\\x80\\x9d he\\ninsisted again\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cso be itâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nhe took out his black pipe and was going to fill it with negrohead\\nwhen looking at the tangle of tobacco in his hand he seemed to think\\nit might perplex the thread of his narrative he put it back again\\nstuck his pipe in a buttonhole of his coat spread a hand on each\\nknee and after turning an angry eye on the fire for a few silent\\nmoments looked round at us and said what follows\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter xlii\\n\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cdear boy and pipâ\\x80\\x99s comrade i am not agoing fur to tell you my life\\nlike a song or a storybook but to

says\\nâ\\x80\\x98donâ\\x80\\x99t leave me whatever you do and thank youâ\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9che rested pretty quiet till it might want a few minutes of five and\\nthen he starts up with a scream and screams out â\\x80\\x98here she is sheâ\\x80\\x99s\\ngot the shroud again sheâ\\x80\\x99s unfolding it sheâ\\x80\\x99s coming out of the\\ncorner sheâ\\x80\\x99s coming to the bed hold me

lift me up to\\nget it round me sheâ\\x80\\x99s lifting me up keep me downâ\\x80\\x99 then he lifted\\nhimself up hard and was dead\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ccompeyson took it easy as a good riddance for both sides him and me\\nwas soon busy and first he swore me being ever artful on my own\\nbookâ\\x80\\x94this here little black book dear boy what i swore your comrade\\non\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnot to go into the things that compeyson planned and i doneâ\\x80\\x94which â\\x80\\x99ud\\ntake a weekâ\\x80\\x94iâ\\x80\\x99ll simply say to you dear boy and pipâ\\x80\\x99s comrade that\\nthat man got me into such nets as made me his black slave i was always\\nin debt to him always under his thumb always a working always a\\ngetting into danger he was younger than me but heâ\\x80\\x99d got craft and\\nheâ\\x80\\x99d got learning and he overmatched me five hundred times told and no\\nmercy my missis as i had the hard time wiâ\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x94stop though i ainâ\\x80\\x99t\\nbrought her inâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nhe looked about him in a confused way as if he had lost his place in\\nthe book of his remembrance and he turned his face to the fire and\\nspread his hands broader on his knees and lifted them off and put them\\non again\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthere ainâ\\x80\\x99t no need to go into itâ\\x80\\x9d he said looking round once more\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthe time wiâ\\x80\\x99 compeyson was aâ\\x80\\x99most as hard a time as ever i had that\\nsaid allâ\\x80\\x99s said did i tell you as i was tried alone for\\nmisdemeanor while with compeysonâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni answered no\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwellâ\\x80\\x9d he said â\\x80\\x9ci was and got convicted as to took up on\\nsuspicion that was twice or three times in the four or five year that\\nit lasted but evidence was wanting at last me and compeyson was both\\ncommitted for felonyâ\\x80\\x94on a charge of putting stolen notes in\\ncirculationâ\\x80\\x94and there was other charges behind compeyson says to me\\nâ\\x80\\x98separate defences no communicationâ\\x80\\x99 and that was all and i was so\\nmiserable poor that i sold all the clothes i had except what hung on\\nmy back afore i could get jaggers\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhen we was put in the dock i noticed first of all what a gentleman\\ncompeyson looked wiâ\\x80\\x99 his curly hair and his black clothes and his\\nwhite pockethandkercher and what a common sort of a wretch i looked\\nwhen the prosecution opened and the evidence was put short aforehand\\ni noticed how heavy it all bore on me and how light on him when the\\nevidence was giv in the box i noticed how it was always me that had\\ncome forâ\\x80\\x99ard and could be swore to how it was always me that the\\nmoney had been paid to how it was always me that had seemed to work\\nthe thing and get the profit but when the defence come on then i see\\nthe plan plainer for says the counsellor for compeyson â\\x80\\x98my lord and\\ngentlemen here you has afore you side by side two persons as your\\neyes can separate wide one the younger well brought up who will be\\nspoke to as such one the elder ill brought up who will be spoke to\\nas such one the younger seldom if ever seen in these here\\ntransactions and only suspected tâ\\x80\\x99other the elder always seen in\\nâ\\x80\\x99em and always wiâ\\x80\\x99 his guilt brought home can you doubt if there is\\nbut one in it which is the one and if there is two in it which is\\nmuch the worst oneâ\\x80\\x99 and suchlike and when it come to character\\nwarnâ\\x80\\x99t it compeyson as had been to the school and warnâ\\x80\\x99t it his\\nschoolfellows as was in this position and in that and warnâ\\x80\\x99t it him as\\nhad been knowâ\\x80\\x99d by witnesses in such clubs and societies and nowt to\\nhis disadvantage and warnâ\\x80\\x99t it me as had been tried afore and as had\\nbeen knowâ\\x80\\x99d up hill and down dale in bridewells and lockups and when\\nit come to speechmaking warnâ\\x80\\x99t it compeyson as could speak to â\\x80\\x99em wiâ\\x80\\x99\\nhis face dropping every now and then into his white\\npockethandkercherâ\\x80\\x94ah and wiâ\\x80\\x99 verses in his speech tooâ\\x80\\x94and warnâ\\x80\\x99t\\nit me as could only say â\\x80\\x98gentlemen this man at my side is a most\\nprecious rascalâ\\x80\\x99 and when the verdict come warnâ\\x80\\x99t it compeyson as was\\nrecommended to mercy on account of good character and bad company and\\ngiving up all the information he could agen me and warnâ\\x80\\x99t it me as got\\nnever a word but guilty and when i says to compeyson â\\x80\\x98once out of\\nthis court iâ\\x80\\x99ll smash that face of yournâ\\x80\\x99 ainâ\\x80\\x99t it compeyson as prays\\nthe judge to be protected and gets two turnkeys stood betwixt us and\\nwhen weâ\\x80\\x99re sentenced ainâ\\x80\\x99t it him as gets seven year and me fourteen\\nand ainâ\\x80\\x99t it him as the judge is sorry for because he might a done so\\nwell and ainâ\\x80\\x99t it me as the judge perceives to be a old offender of\\nwiolent passion likely to come to worseâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nhe had worked himself into a state of great excitement but he checked\\nit took two or three short breaths swallowed as often and stretching\\nout his hand towards me said in a reassuring manner â\\x80\\x9ci ainâ\\x80\\x99t agoing\\nto be low dear boyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nhe had so heated himself that he took out his handkerchief and wiped\\nhis face and head and neck and hands before he could go on\\n\\nillustration\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci had said to compeyson that iâ\\x80\\x99d smash that face of his and i swore\\nlord smash mine to do it we was in the same prisonship but i\\ncouldnâ\\x80\\x99t get at him for long though i tried at last i come behind him\\nand hit him on the cheek to turn him round and get a smashing one at\\nhim when i was seen and seized the blackhole of that ship warnâ\\x80\\x99t a\\nstrong one to a judge of blackholes that could swim and dive i\\nescaped to the shore and i was a hiding among the graves there\\nenvying them as was in â\\x80\\x99em and all over when i first see my boyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nhe regarded me with a look of affection that made him almost abhorrent\\nto me again though i had felt great pity for him\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cby my boy i was giv to understand as compeyson was out on them\\nmarshes too upon my soul i half believe he escaped in his terror to\\nget quit of me not knowing it was me as had got ashore i hunted him\\ndown i smashed his face â\\x80\\x98and nowâ\\x80\\x99 says i â\\x80\\x98as the worst thing i can\\ndo caring nothing for myself iâ\\x80\\x99ll drag you backâ\\x80\\x99 and iâ\\x80\\x99d have swum\\noff towing him by the hair if it had come to that and iâ\\x80\\x99d a got him\\naboard without the soldiers\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cof course heâ\\x80\\x99d much the best of it to the lastâ\\x80\\x94his character was so\\ngood he had escaped when he was made half wild by me and my murderous\\nintentions and his punishment was light i was put in irons brought\\nto trial again and sent for life i didnâ\\x80\\x99t stop for life dear boy and\\npipâ\\x80\\x99s comrade being hereâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nhe wiped himself again as he had done before and then slowly took his\\ntangle of tobacco from his pocket and plucked his pipe from his\\nbuttonhole and slowly filled it and began to smoke\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cis he deadâ\\x80\\x9d i asked after a silence\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cis who dead dear boyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ccompeysonâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9che hopes i am if heâ\\x80\\x99s alive you may be sureâ\\x80\\x9d with a fierce look\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci never heerd no more of himâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nherbert had been writing with his pencil in the cover of a book he\\nsoftly pushed the book over to me as provis stood smoking with his\\neyes on the fire and i read in itâ\\x80\\x94\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyoung havishamâ\\x80\\x99s name was arthur compeyson is the man who professed\\nto be miss havishamâ\\x80\\x99s loverâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni shut the book and nodded slightly to herbert and put the book by\\nbut we neither of us said anything and both looked at provis as he\\nstood smoking by the fire\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter xliii\\n\\n\\nwhy should i pause to ask how much of my shrinking from provis might be\\ntraced to estella why should i loiter on my road to compare the state\\nof mind in which i had tried to rid myself of the stain of the prison\\nbefore meeting her at the coachoffice with the state of mind in which\\ni now reflected on the abyss between estella in her pride and beauty\\nand the returned transport whom i harboured the road would be none the\\nsmoother for it the end would be none the better for it he would not\\nbe helped nor i extenuated\\n\\na new fear had been engendered in my mind by his narrative or rather\\nhis narrative had given form and purpose to the fear that was already\\nthere if compeyson were alive and should discover his return i could\\nhardly doubt the consequence that compeyson stood in mortal fear of\\nhim neither of the two could know much better than i and that any\\nsuch man as that man had been described to be would hesitate to release\\nhimself for good from a dreaded enemy by the safe means of becoming an\\ninformer was scarcely to be imagined\\n\\nnever had i breathed and never would i breatheâ\\x80\\x94or so i resolvedâ\\x80\\x94a word\\nof estella to provis but i said to herbert that before i could go\\nabroad i must see both estella and miss havisham this was when we\\nwere left alone on the night of the day when provis told us his story\\ni resolved to go out to richmond next day and i went\\n\\non my presenting myself at mrs brandleyâ\\x80\\x99s estellaâ\\x80\\x99s maid was called\\nto tell that estella had gone into the country where to satis house\\nas usual not as usual i said for she had never yet gone there\\nwithout me when was she coming back there was an air of reservation\\nin the answer which increased my perplexity and the answer was that\\nher maid believed she was only coming back at all for a little while i\\ncould make nothing of this except that it was meant that i should make\\nnothing of it and i went home again in complete discomfiture\\n\\nanother night consultation with herbert after provis was gone home i\\nalways took him home and always looked well about me led us to the\\nconclusion that nothing should be said about going abroad until i came\\nback from miss havishamâ\\x80\\x99s in the mean time herbert and i were to\\nconsider separately what it would be best to say whether we should\\ndevise any pretence of being afraid that he was under suspicious\\nobservation or whether i who had never yet been abroad should\\npropose an expedition we both knew that i had but to propose anything\\nand he would consent we agreed that his remaining many days in his\\npresent hazard was not to be thought of\\n\\nnext day i had the meanness to feign that i was under a binding promise\\nto go down to joe but i was capable of almost any meanness towards joe\\nor his name provis was to be strictly careful while i was gone and\\nherbert was to take the charge of him that i had taken i was to be\\nabsent only one night and on my return the gratification of his\\nimpatience for my starting as a gentleman on a greater scale was to be\\nbegun it occurred to me then and as i afterwards found to herbert\\nalso that he might be best got away across the water on that\\npretenceâ\\x80\\x94as to make purchases or the like\\n\\nhaving thus cleared the way for my expedition to miss havishamâ\\x80\\x99s i set\\noff by the early morning coach before it was yet light and was out on\\nthe open country road when the day came creeping on halting and\\nwhimpering and shivering and wrapped in patches of cloud and rags of\\nmist like a beggar when we drove up to the blue boar after a drizzly\\nride whom should i see come out under the gateway toothpick in hand\\nto look at the coach but bentley drummle\\n\\nas he pretended not to see me i pretended not to see him it was a\\nvery lame pretence on both sides the lamer because we both went into\\nthe coffeeroom where he had just finished his breakfast and where i\\nordered mine it was poisonous to me to see him in the town for i very\\nwell knew why he had come there\\n\\npretending to read a smeary newspaper long out of date which had\\nnothing half so legible in its local news as the foreign matter of\\ncoffee pickles fish sauces gravy melted butter and wine with which\\nit was sprinkled all over as if it had taken the measles in a highly\\nirregular form i sat at my table while he stood before the fire by\\ndegrees it became an enormous injury to me that he stood before the\\nfire and i got up determined to have my share of it i had to put my\\nhand behind his legs for the poker when i went up to the fireplace to\\nstir the fire but still pretended not to know him\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cis this a cutâ\\x80\\x9d said mr drummle\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cohâ\\x80\\x9d said i poker in hand â\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s you is it how do you do i was\\nwondering who it was who kept the fire offâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nwith that i poked tremendously and having done so planted myself\\nside by side with mr drummle my shoulders squared and my back to the\\nfire\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou have just come downâ\\x80\\x9d said mr drummle edging me a little away\\nwith his shoulder\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyesâ\\x80\\x9d said i edging him a little away with my shoulder\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbeastly placeâ\\x80\\x9d said drummle â\\x80\\x9cyour part of the country i thinkâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyesâ\\x80\\x9d i assented â\\x80\\x9ci am told itâ\\x80\\x99s very like your shropshireâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnot in the least like itâ\\x80\\x9d said drummle\\n\\nhere mr drummle looked at his boots and i looked at mine and then mr\\ndrummle looked at my boots and i looked at his\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9chave you been here longâ\\x80\\x9d i asked determined not to yield an inch of\\nthe fire\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9clong enough to be tired of itâ\\x80\\x9d returned drummle pretending to yawn\\nbut equally determined\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cdo you stay here longâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ccanâ\\x80\\x99t sayâ\\x80\\x9d answered mr drummle â\\x80\\x9cdo youâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ccanâ\\x80\\x99t sayâ\\x80\\x9d said i\\n\\ni felt here through a tingling in my blood that if mr drummleâ\\x80\\x99s\\nshoulder had claimed another hairâ\\x80\\x99s breadth of room i should have\\njerked him into the window equally that if my own shoulder had urged\\na similar claim mr drummle would have jerked me into the nearest box\\nhe whistled a little so did i\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9clarge tract of marshes about here i believeâ\\x80\\x9d said drummle\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyes what of thatâ\\x80\\x9d said i\\n\\nmr drummle looked at me and then at my boots and then said â\\x80\\x9cohâ\\x80\\x9d\\nand laughed\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9care you amused mr drummleâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnoâ\\x80\\x9d said he â\\x80\\x9cnot particularly i am going out for a ride in the\\nsaddle i mean to explore those marshes for amusement outoftheway\\nvillages there they tell me curious little publichousesâ\\x80\\x94and\\nsmithiesâ\\x80\\x94and that waiterâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyes sirâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cis that horse of mine readyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbrought round to the door sirâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci say look here you

dine at the ladyâ\\x80\\x99sâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cvery good sirâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthen drummle glanced at me with an insolent triumph on his\\ngreatjowled face that cut me to the heart dull as he was and so\\nexasperated me that i felt inclined to take him in my arms as the\\nrobber in the storybook is said to have taken the old lady and seat\\nhim on the fire\\n\\none thing was manifest to both of us and that was that until relief\\ncame neither of us could relinquish the fire there we stood well\\nsquared up before it shoulder to shoulder and foot to foot with our\\nhands behind us not budging an inch the horse was visible outside in\\nthe drizzle at the door my breakfast was put on the table drummleâ\\x80\\x99s\\nwas cleared away the waiter invited me to begin i nodded we both\\nstood our ground\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9chave you been to the grove sinceâ\\x80\\x9d said drummle\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnoâ\\x80\\x9d said i â\\x80\\x9ci had quite enough of the finches the last time i was\\nthereâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwas that when we had a difference of opinionâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyesâ\\x80\\x9d i replied very shortly\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ccome come they let you off easily

him once or twice in an increased state of\\nsmouldering ferocity i saidâ\\x80\\x94\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmr drummle i did not seek this conversation and i donâ\\x80\\x99t think it an\\nagreeable oneâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci am sure itâ\\x80\\x99s notâ\\x80\\x9d said he superciliously over his shoulder â\\x80\\x9ci\\ndonâ\\x80\\x99t think anything about itâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cand

fastcooling teapot with the palm of his\\nhand and had looked imploringly at me and had gone out drummle\\ncareful not to move the shoulder next me took a cigar from his pocket\\nand bit the end off but showed no sign of stirring choking and\\nboiling as i was i felt that we could not go a word further without\\nintroducing estellaâ\\x80\\x99s name which i could not endure to hear him utter\\nand therefore i looked stonily at the opposite wall as if there were\\nno one present and forced myself to silence how long we might have\\nremained in this ridiculous position it is impossible to say but for\\nthe incursion of three thriving farmersâ\\x80\\x94laid on by the waiter i\\nthinkâ\\x80\\x94who came into the coffeeroom unbuttoning their greatcoats and\\nrubbing their hands and before whom as they charged at the fire we\\nwere obliged to give way\\n\\ni saw him through the window seizing his horseâ\\x80\\x99s mane and mounting in\\nhis blundering brutal manner and sidling and backing away i thought\\nhe was gone when he came back calling for a light for the cigar in\\nhis mouth which he had forgotten a man in a dustcoloured dress\\nappeared with what was wantedâ\\x80\\x94i could not have said from where\\nwhether from the inn yard or the street or where notâ\\x80\\x94and as drummle\\nleaned down from the saddle and lighted his cigar and laughed with a\\njerk of his head towards the coffeeroom windows the slouching\\nshoulders and ragged hair of this man whose back was towards me\\nreminded me of orlick\\n\\ntoo heavily out of sorts to care much at the time whether it were he or\\nno or after all to touch the breakfast i washed the weather and the\\njourney from my face and hands and went out to the memorable old house\\nthat it would have been so much the better for me never to have\\nentered never to have seen\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter xliv\\n\\n\\nin the room where the dressingtable stood and where the waxcandles\\nburnt on the wall i found miss havisham and estella miss havisham\\nseated on a settee near the fire and estella on a cushion at her feet\\nestella was knitting and miss havisham was looking on they both\\nraised their eyes as i went in and both saw an alteration in me i\\nderived that from the look they interchanged\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cand what windâ\\x80\\x9d said miss havisham â\\x80\\x9cblows you here pipâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthough she looked steadily at me i saw that she was rather confused\\nestella pausing a moment in her knitting with her eyes upon me and\\nthen going on i fancied that i read in the action of her fingers as\\nplainly as if she had told me in the dumb alphabet that she perceived\\ni had discovered my real benefactor\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmiss havishamâ\\x80\\x9d said i â\\x80\\x9ci went to richmond yesterday to speak to\\nestella and finding that some wind had blown her here i followedâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nmiss havisham motioning to me for the third or fourth time to sit down\\ni took the chair by the dressingtable which i had often seen her\\noccupy with all that ruin at my feet and about me it seemed a natural\\nplace for me that day\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhat i had to say to estella miss havisham i will say before you\\npresentlyâ\\x80\\x94in a few moments it will not surprise you it will not\\ndisplease you i am as unhappy as you can ever have meant me to beâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nmiss havisham continued to look steadily at me i could see in the\\naction of estellaâ\\x80\\x99s fingers as they worked that she attended to what i\\nsaid but she did not look up\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci have found out who my patron is it is not a fortunate discovery\\nand is not likely ever to enrich me in reputation station fortune\\nanything there are reasons why i must say no more of that it is not\\nmy secret but anotherâ\\x80\\x99sâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nas i was silent for a while looking at estella and considering how to\\ngo on miss havisham repeated â\\x80\\x9cit is not your secret but anotherâ\\x80\\x99s\\nwellâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhen you first caused me to be brought here miss havisham when i\\nbelonged to the village over yonder that i wish i had never left i\\nsuppose i did really come here as any other chance boy might have\\ncomeâ\\x80\\x94as a kind of servant to gratify a want or a whim and to be paid\\nfor itâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cay pipâ\\x80\\x9d replied miss havisham steadily nodding her head â\\x80\\x9cyou didâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cand that mr jaggersâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmr jaggersâ\\x80\\x9d said miss havisham taking me up in a firm tone â\\x80\\x9chad\\nnothing to do with it and knew nothing of it his being my lawyer and\\nhis being the lawyer of your patron is a coincidence he holds the same\\nrelation towards numbers of people and it might easily arise be that\\nas it may it did arise and was not brought about by any oneâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nany one might have seen in her haggard face that there was no\\nsuppression or evasion so far\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbut when i fell into the mistake i have so long remained in at least\\nyou led me onâ\\x80\\x9d said i\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyesâ\\x80\\x9d she returned again nodding steadily â\\x80\\x9ci let you go onâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwas that kindâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwho am iâ\\x80\\x9d cried miss havisham striking her stick upon the floor and\\nflashing into wrath so suddenly that estella glanced up at her in\\nsurpriseâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cwho am i for godâ\\x80\\x99s sake that i should be kindâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nit was a weak complaint to have made and i had not meant to make it i\\ntold her so as she sat brooding after this outburst\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwell well wellâ\\x80\\x9d she said â\\x80\\x9cwhat elseâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci was liberally paid for my old attendance hereâ\\x80\\x9d i said to soothe\\nher â\\x80\\x9cin being apprenticed and i have asked these questions only for\\nmy own information what follows has another and i hope more\\ndisinterested purpose in humouring my mistake miss havisham you\\npunishedâ\\x80\\x94practised onâ\\x80\\x94perhaps you will supply whatever term expresses\\nyour intention without offenceâ\\x80\\x94your selfseeking relationsâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci did why they would have it so so would you what has been my\\nhistory that i should be at the pains of entreating either them or you\\nnot to have it so you made your own snares i never made themâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nwaiting until she was quiet againâ\\x80\\x94for this too flashed out of her in\\na wild and sudden wayâ\\x80\\x94i went on\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci have been thrown among one family of your relations miss havisham\\nand have been constantly among them since i went to london i know them\\nto have been as honestly under my delusion as i myself and i should be\\nfalse and base if i did not tell you whether it is acceptable to you\\nor no and whether you are inclined to give credence to it or no that\\nyou deeply wrong both mr matthew pocket and his son herbert if you\\nsuppose them to be otherwise than generous upright open and\\nincapable of anything designing or meanâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthey are your friendsâ\\x80\\x9d said miss havisham\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthey made themselves my friendsâ\\x80\\x9d said i â\\x80\\x9cwhen they supposed me to\\nhave superseded them and when sarah pocket miss georgiana and\\nmistress camilla were not my friends i thinkâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthis contrasting of them with the rest seemed i was glad to see to do\\nthem good with her she looked at me keenly for a little while and\\nthen said quietlyâ\\x80\\x94\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhat do you want for themâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9conlyâ\\x80\\x9d said i â\\x80\\x9cthat you would not confound them with the others they\\nmay be of the same blood but believe me they are not of the same\\nnatureâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nstill looking at me keenly miss havisham repeatedâ\\x80\\x94\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhat do you want for themâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci am not so cunning you seeâ\\x80\\x9d i said in answer conscious that i\\nreddened a little â\\x80\\x9cas that i could hide from you even if i desired\\nthat i do want something miss havisham if you would spare the money\\nto do my friend herbert a lasting service in life but which from the\\nnature of the case must be done without his knowledge i could show you\\nhowâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhy must it be done without his knowledgeâ\\x80\\x9d she asked settling her\\nhands upon her stick that she might regard me the more attentively\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbecauseâ\\x80\\x9d said i â\\x80\\x9ci began the service myself more than two years\\nago without his knowledge and i donâ\\x80\\x99t want to be betrayed why i fail\\nin my ability to finish it i cannot explain it is a part of the\\nsecret which is another personâ\\x80\\x99s and not mineâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nshe gradually withdrew her eyes from me and turned them on the fire\\nafter watching it for what appeared in the silence and by the light of\\nthe slowly wasting candles to be a long time she was roused by the\\ncollapse of some of the red coals and looked towards me againâ\\x80\\x94at\\nfirst vacantlyâ\\x80\\x94then with a gradually concentrating attention all\\nthis time estella knitted on when miss havisham had fixed her\\nattention on me she said speaking as if there had been no lapse in\\nour dialogueâ\\x80\\x94\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhat elseâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cestellaâ\\x80\\x9d said i turning to her now and trying to command my\\ntrembling voice â\\x80\\x9cyou know i love you you know that i have loved you\\nlong and dearlyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nshe raised her eyes to my face on being thus addressed and her\\nfingers plied their work and she looked at me with an unmoved\\ncountenance i saw that miss havisham glanced from me to her and from\\nher to me\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci should have said this sooner but for my long mistake it induced me\\nto hope that miss havisham meant us for one another while i thought\\nyou could not help yourself as it were i refrained from saying it\\nbut i must say it nowâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\npreserving her unmoved countenance and with her fingers still going\\nestella shook her head\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci knowâ\\x80\\x9d said i in answer to that actionâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9ci know i have no hope\\nthat i shall ever call you mine estella i am ignorant what may become\\nof me very soon how poor i may be or where i may go still i love\\nyou i have loved you ever since i first saw you in this houseâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nlooking at me perfectly unmoved and with her fingers busy she shook\\nher head again\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cit would have been cruel in miss havisham horribly cruel to practise\\non the susceptibility of a poor boy and to torture me through all\\nthese years with a vain hope and an idle pursuit if she had reflected\\non the gravity of what she did but i think she did not i think that\\nin the endurance of her own trial she forgot mine estellaâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni saw miss havisham put her hand to her heart and hold it there as she\\nsat looking by turns at estella and at me\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cit seemsâ\\x80\\x9d said estella very calmly â\\x80\\x9cthat there are sentiments\\nfanciesâ\\x80\\x94i donâ\\x80\\x99t know how to call themâ\\x80\\x94which i am not able to\\ncomprehend when you say you love me i know what you mean as a form\\nof words but nothing more you address nothing in my breast you touch\\nnothing there i donâ\\x80\\x99t care for what you say at all i have tried to\\nwarn you of this now have i notâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni said in a miserable manner â\\x80\\x9cyesâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyes but you would not be warned for you thought i did not mean it\\nnow did you not think soâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci thought and hoped you could not mean it you so young untried and\\nbeautiful estella surely it is not in natureâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cit is in my natureâ\\x80\\x9d she returned and then she added with a stress\\nupon the words â\\x80\\x9cit is in the nature formed within me i make a great\\ndifference between you and all other people when i say so much i can\\ndo no moreâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cis it not trueâ\\x80\\x9d said i â\\x80\\x9cthat bentley drummle is in town here and\\npursuing youâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cit is quite trueâ\\x80\\x9d she replied referring to him with the indifference\\nof utter contempt\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthat you encourage him and ride out with him and that he dines with\\nyou this very dayâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nshe seemed a little surprised that i should know it but again replied\\nâ\\x80\\x9cquite trueâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou cannot love him estellaâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nher fingers stopped for the first time as she retorted rather angrily\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhat have i told you do you still think in spite of it that i do\\nnot mean what i sayâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou would never marry him estellaâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nshe looked towards miss havisham and considered for a moment with her\\nwork in her hands then she said â\\x80\\x9cwhy not tell you the truth i am\\ngoing to be married to himâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni dropped my face into my hands but was able to control myself better\\nthan i could have expected considering what agony it gave me to hear\\nher say those words when i raised my face again there was such a\\nghastly look upon miss havishamâ\\x80\\x99s that it impressed me even in my\\npassionate hurry and grief\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cestella dearest estella do not let miss havisham lead you into this\\nfatal step put me aside for everâ\\x80\\x94you have done so i well knowâ\\x80\\x94but\\nbestow yourself on some worthier person than drummle miss havisham\\ngives you to him as the greatest slight and injury that could be done\\nto the many far better men who admire you and to the few who truly\\nlove you among those few there may be one who loves you even as\\ndearly though he has not loved you as long as i take him and i can\\nbear it better for your sakeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nmy earnestness awoke a wonder in her that seemed as if it would have\\nbeen touched with compassion if she could have rendered me at all\\nintelligible to her own mind\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci am goingâ\\x80\\x9d she said again in a gentler voice â\\x80\\x9cto be married to\\nhim the preparations for my marriage are making and i shall be\\nmarried soon why do you injuriously introduce the name of my mother by\\nadoption it is my own actâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyour own act estella to fling yourself away upon a bruteâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9con whom should i fling myself awayâ\\x80\\x9d she retorted with a smile\\nâ\\x80\\x9cshould i fling myself away upon the man who would the soonest feel if\\npeople do feel such things that i took nothing to him there it is\\ndone i shall do well enough and so will my husband as to leading me\\ninto what you call this fatal step miss havisham would have had me\\nwait and not marry yet but i am tired of the life i have led which\\nhas very few charms for me and i am willing enough to change it say\\nno more we shall never understand each otherâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9csuch a mean brute such a stupid bruteâ\\x80\\x9d i urged in despair\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cdonâ\\x80\\x99t be afraid of my being a blessing to himâ\\x80\\x9d said estella â\\x80\\x9ci shall\\nnot be that come here is my hand do we part on this you visionary\\nboyâ\\x80\\x94or manâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9co estellaâ\\x80\\x9d i answered as my bitter tears fell fast on her hand do\\nwhat i would to restrain them â\\x80\\x9ceven if i remained in england and could\\nhold my head up with the rest how could i see you drummleâ\\x80\\x99s wifeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnonsenseâ\\x80\\x9d she returnedâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cnonsense this will pass in no timeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnever estellaâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou will get me out of your thoughts in a weekâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cout of my thoughts you are part of my existence part of myself you\\nhave been in every line i have ever read since i first came here the\\nrough common boy whose poor heart you wounded even then you have been\\nin every prospect i have ever seen sinceâ\\x80\\x94on the river on the sails of\\nthe ships on the marshes in the clouds in the light in the\\ndarkness in the wind in the woods in the sea in the streets you\\nhave been the embodiment of every graceful fancy that my mind has ever\\nbecome acquainted with the stones of which the strongest london\\nbuildings are made are not more real or more impossible to be\\ndisplaced by your hands than your presence and influence have been to\\nme there and everywhere and will be estella to the last hour of my\\nlife you cannot choose but remain part of my character part of the\\nlittle good in me part of the evil but in this separation i\\nassociate you only with the good and i will faithfully hold you to\\nthat always for you must have done me far more good than harm let me\\nfeel now what sharp distress i may o god bless you god forgive youâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nin what ecstasy of unhappiness i got these broken words out of myself\\ni donâ\\x80\\x99t know the rhapsody welled up within me like blood from an\\ninward wound and gushed out i held her hand to my lips some lingering\\nmoments and so i left her but ever afterwards i rememberedâ\\x80\\x94and soon\\nafterwards with stronger reasonâ\\x80\\x94that while estella looked at me merely\\nwith incredulous wonder the spectral figure of miss havisham her hand\\nstill covering her heart seemed all resolved into a ghastly stare of\\npity and remorse\\n\\nall done all gone so much was done and gone that when i went out at\\nthe gate the light of the day seemed of a darker colour than when i\\nwent in for a while i hid myself among some lanes and bypaths and\\nthen struck off to walk all the way to london for i had by that time\\ncome to myself so far as to consider that i could not go back to the\\ninn and see drummle there that i could not bear to sit upon the coach\\nand be spoken to that i could do nothing half so good for myself as\\ntire myself out\\n\\nit was past midnight when i crossed london bridge pursuing the narrow\\nintricacies of the streets which at that time tended westward near the\\nmiddlesex shore of the river my readiest access to the temple was\\nclose by the riverside through whitefriars i was not expected till\\ntomorrow but i had my keys and if herbert were gone to bed could\\nget to bed myself without disturbing him\\n\\nas it seldom happened that i came in at that whitefriars gate after the\\ntemple was closed and as i was very muddy and weary i did not take it\\nill that the nightporter examined me with much attention as he held\\nthe gate a little way open for me to pass in to help his memory i\\nmentioned my name\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci was not quite sure sir but i thought so hereâ\\x80\\x99s a note sir the\\nmessenger that brought it said would you be so good as read it by my\\nlanternâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nillustration\\n\\nmuch surprised by the request i took the note it was directed to\\nphilip pip esquire and on the top of the superscription were the\\nwords â\\x80\\x9cplease read this hereâ\\x80\\x9d i opened it the watchman holding up\\nhis light and read inside in wemmickâ\\x80\\x99s writingâ\\x80\\x94\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cdonâ\\x80\\x99t go homeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter xlv\\n\\n\\nturning from the temple gate as soon as i had read the warning i made\\nthe best of my way to fleet street and there got a late hackney\\nchariot and drove to the hummums in covent garden in those times a bed\\nwas always to be got there at any hour of the night and the\\nchamberlain letting me in at his ready wicket lighted the candle next\\nin order on his shelf and showed me straight into the bedroom next in\\norder on his list it was a sort of vault on the ground floor at the\\nback with a despotic monster of a fourpost bedstead in it straddling\\nover the whole place putting one of his arbitrary legs into the\\nfireplace and another into the doorway and squeezing the wretched\\nlittle washingstand in quite a divinely righteous manner\\n\\nas i had asked for a nightlight the chamberlain had brought me in\\nbefore he left me the good old constitutional rushlight of those\\nvirtuous daysâ\\x80\\x94an object like the ghost of a walkingcane which\\ninstantly broke its back if it were touched which nothing could ever\\nbe lighted at and which was placed in solitary confinement at the\\nbottom of a high tin tower perforated with round holes that made a\\nstaringly wideawake pattern on the walls when i had got into bed and\\nlay there footsore weary and wretched i found that i could no more\\nclose my own eyes than i could close the eyes of this foolish argus\\nand thus in the gloom and death of the night we stared at one\\nanother\\n\\nwhat a doleful night how anxious how dismal how long there was an\\ninhospitable smell in the room of cold soot and hot dust and as i\\nlooked up into the corners of the tester over my head i thought what a\\nnumber of bluebottle flies from the butchersâ\\x80\\x99 and earwigs from the\\nmarket and grubs from the country must be holding on up there lying\\nby for next summer this led me to speculate whether any of them ever\\ntumbled down and then i fancied that i felt light falls on my faceâ\\x80\\x94a\\ndisagreeable turn of thought suggesting other and more objectionable\\napproaches up my back when i had lain awake a little while those\\nextraordinary voices with which silence teems began to make themselves\\naudible the closet whispered the fireplace sighed the little\\nwashingstand ticked and one guitarstring played occasionally in the\\nchest of drawers at about the same time the eyes on the wall acquired\\na new expression and in every one of those staring rounds i saw\\nwritten donâ\\x80\\x99t go home\\n\\nwhatever nightfancies and nightnoises crowded on me they never\\nwarded off this donâ\\x80\\x99t go home it plaited itself into whatever i\\nthought of as a bodily pain would have done not long before i had\\nread in the newspapers how a gentleman unknown had come to the hummums\\nin the night and had gone to bed and had destroyed himself and had\\nbeen found in the morning weltering in blood it came into my head that\\nhe must have occupied this very vault of mine and i got out of bed to\\nassure myself that there were no red marks about then opened the door\\nto look out into the passages and cheer myself with the companionship\\nof a distant light near which i knew the chamberlain to be dozing but\\nall this time why i was not to go home and what had happened at home\\nand when i should go home and whether provis was safe at home were\\nquestions occupying my mind so busily that one might have supposed\\nthere could be no more room in it for any other theme even when i\\nthought of estella and how we had parted that day forever and when i\\nrecalled all the circumstances of our parting and all her looks and\\ntones and the action of her fingers while she knittedâ\\x80\\x94even then i was\\npursuing here and there and everywhere the caution donâ\\x80\\x99t go home\\nwhen at last i dozed in sheer exhaustion of mind and body it became a\\nvast shadowy verb which i had to conjugate imperative mood present\\ntense do not thou go home let him not go home let us not go home do\\nnot ye or you go home let not them go home then potentially i may\\nnot and i cannot go home and i might not could not would not and\\nshould not go home until i felt that i was going distracted and\\nrolled over on the pillow and looked at the staring rounds upon the\\nwall again\\n\\ni had left directions that i was to be called at seven for it was\\nplain that i must see wemmick before seeing any one else and equally\\nplain that this was a case in which his walworth sentiments only could\\nbe taken it was a relief to get out of the room where the night had\\nbeen so miserable and i needed no second knocking at the door to\\nstartle me from my uneasy bed\\n\\nthe castle battlements arose upon my view at eight oâ\\x80\\x99clock the little\\nservant happening to be entering the fortress with two hot rolls i\\npassed through the postern and crossed the drawbridge in her company\\nand so came without announcement into the presence of wemmick as he was\\nmaking tea for himself and the aged an open door afforded a\\nperspective view of the aged in bed\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9challoa mr pipâ\\x80\\x9d said wemmick â\\x80\\x9cyou did come home thenâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyesâ\\x80\\x9d i returned â\\x80\\x9cbut i didnâ\\x80\\x99t go homeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthatâ\\x80\\x99s all rightâ\\x80\\x9d said he rubbing his hands â\\x80\\x9ci left a note for you\\nat each of the temple gates on the chance which gate did you come\\ntoâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni told him\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ciâ\\x80\\x99ll go round to the others in the course of the day and destroy the\\nnotesâ\\x80\\x9d said wemmick â\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s a good rule never to leave documentary\\nevidence if you can help it because you donâ\\x80\\x99t know when it may be put\\nin iâ\\x80\\x99m going to take a liberty with you would you mind toasting\\nthis sausage for the aged pâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni said i should be delighted to do it\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthen you can go about your work mary anneâ\\x80\\x9d said wemmick to the\\nlittle servant â\\x80\\x9cwhich leaves us to ourselves donâ\\x80\\x99t you see mr pipâ\\x80\\x9d\\nhe added winking as she disappeared\\n\\ni thanked him for his friendship and caution and our discourse\\nproceeded in a low tone while i toasted the agedâ\\x80\\x99s sausage and he\\nbuttered the crumb of the agedâ\\x80\\x99s roll\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnow mr pip you knowâ\\x80\\x9d said wemmick â\\x80\\x9cyou and i understand one\\nanother we are in our private and personal capacities and we have\\nbeen engaged in a confidential transaction before today official\\nsentiments are one thing we are extra officialâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni cordially assented i was so very nervous that i had already lighted\\nthe agedâ\\x80\\x99s sausage like a torch and been obliged to blow it out\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci accidentally heard yesterday morningâ\\x80\\x9d said wemmick â\\x80\\x9cbeing in a\\ncertain place where i once took youâ\\x80\\x94even between you and me itâ\\x80\\x99s as\\nwell not to mention names when avoidableâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmuch better notâ\\x80\\x9d said i â\\x80\\x9ci understand youâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci heard there by chance yesterday morningâ\\x80\\x9d said wemmick â\\x80\\x9cthat a\\ncertain person not altogether of uncolonial pursuits and not\\nunpossessed of portable propertyâ\\x80\\x94i donâ\\x80\\x99t know who it may really beâ\\x80\\x94we\\nwonâ\\x80\\x99t name this personâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnot necessaryâ\\x80\\x9d said i\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x94had made some little stir in a certain part of the world where a good\\nmany people go not always in gratification of their own inclinations\\nand not quite irrespective of the government expenseâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nin watching his face i made quite a firework of the agedâ\\x80\\x99s sausage\\nand greatly discomposed both my own attention and wemmickâ\\x80\\x99s for which\\ni apologised\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x94by disappearing from such place and being no more heard of\\nthereabouts from whichâ\\x80\\x9d said wemmick â\\x80\\x9cconjectures had been raised\\nand theories formed i also heard that you at your chambers in garden\\ncourt temple had been watched and might be watched againâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cby whomâ\\x80\\x9d said i\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t go into thatâ\\x80\\x9d said wemmick evasively â\\x80\\x9cit might clash\\nwith official responsibilities i heard it as i have in my time heard\\nother curious things in the same place i donâ\\x80\\x99t tell it you on\\ninformation received i heard itâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nhe took the toastingfork and sausage from me as he spoke and set\\nforth the agedâ\\x80\\x99s breakfast neatly on a little tray previous to placing\\nit before him he went into the agedâ\\x80\\x99s room with a clean white cloth\\nand tied the same under the old gentlemanâ\\x80\\x99s chin and propped him up\\nand put his nightcap on one side and gave him quite a rakish air then\\nhe placed his breakfast before him with great care and said â\\x80\\x9call\\nright ainâ\\x80\\x99t you aged pâ\\x80\\x9d to which the cheerful aged replied â\\x80\\x9call\\nright john my boy all rightâ\\x80\\x9d as there seemed to be a tacit\\nunderstanding that the aged was not in a presentable state and was\\ntherefore to be considered invisible i made a pretence of being in\\ncomplete ignorance of these proceedings\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthis watching of me at my chambers which i have once had reason to\\nsuspectâ\\x80\\x9d i said to wemmick when he came back â\\x80\\x9cis inseparable from\\nthe person to whom you have adverted is itâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nwemmick looked very serious â\\x80\\x9ci couldnâ\\x80\\x99t undertake to say that of my\\nown knowledge i mean i couldnâ\\x80\\x99t undertake to say it was at first but\\nit either is or it will be or itâ\\x80\\x99s in great danger of beingâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nas i saw that he was restrained by fealty to little britain from saying\\nas much as he could and as i knew with thankfulness to him how far out\\nof his way he went to say what he did i could not press him but i\\ntold him after a little meditation over the fire that i would like to\\nask him a question subject to his answering or not answering as he\\ndeemed right and sure that his course would be right he paused in his\\nbreakfast and crossing his arms and pinching his shirtsleeves his\\nnotion of indoor comfort was to sit without any coat he nodded to me\\nonce to put my question\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou have heard of a man of bad character whose true name is\\ncompeysonâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nhe answered with one other nod\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cis he livingâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\none other nod\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cis he in londonâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nhe gave me one other nod compressed the postoffice exceedingly gave\\nme one last nod and went on with his breakfast\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnowâ\\x80\\x9d said wemmick â\\x80\\x9cquestioning being overâ\\x80\\x9d which he emphasised and\\nrepeated for my guidance â\\x80\\x9ci come to what i did after hearing what i\\nheard i went to garden court to find you not finding you i went to\\nclarrikerâ\\x80\\x99s to find mr herbertâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cand him you foundâ\\x80\\x9d said i with great anxiety\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cand him i found without mentioning any names or going into any\\ndetails i gave him to understand that if he was aware of anybodyâ\\x80\\x94tom\\njack or richardâ\\x80\\x94being about the chambers or about the immediate\\nneighbourhood he had better get tom jack or richard out of the way\\nwhile you were out of the wayâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9che would be greatly puzzled what to doâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9che was puzzled what to do not the less because i gave him my\\nopinion that it was not safe to try to get tom jack or richard too\\nfar out of the way at present mr pip iâ\\x80\\x99ll tell you something under\\nexisting circumstances there is no place like a great city when you\\nare once in it donâ\\x80\\x99t break cover too soon lie close wait till things\\nslacken before you try the open even for foreign airâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni thanked him for his valuable advice and asked him what herbert had\\ndone\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmr herbertâ\\x80\\x9d said wemmick â\\x80\\x9cafter being all of a heap for half an\\nhour struck out a plan he mentioned to me as a secret that he is\\ncourting a young lady who has as no doubt you are aware a bedridden\\npa which pa having been in the purser line of life lies abed in a\\nbowwindow where he can see the ships sail up and down the river you\\nare acquainted with the young lady most probablyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnot personallyâ\\x80\\x9d said i\\n\\nthe truth was that she had objected to me as an expensive companion\\nwho did herbert no good and that when herbert had first proposed to\\npresent me to her she had received the proposal with such very\\nmoderate warmth that herbert had felt himself obliged to confide the\\nstate of the case to me with a view to the lapse of a little time\\nbefore i made her acquaintance when i had begun to advance herbertâ\\x80\\x99s\\nprospects by stealth i had been able to bear this with cheerful\\nphilosophy he and his affianced for their part had naturally not\\nbeen very anxious to introduce a third person into their interviews\\nand thus although i was assured that i had risen in claraâ\\x80\\x99s esteem\\nand although the young lady and i had long regularly interchanged\\nmessages and remembrances by herbert i had never seen her however i\\ndid not trouble wemmick with these particulars\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthe house with the bowwindowâ\\x80\\x9d said wemmick â\\x80\\x9cbeing by the\\nriverside down the pool there between limehouse and greenwich and\\nbeing kept it seems by a very respectable widow who has a furnished\\nupper floor to let mr herbert put it to me what did i think of that\\nas a temporary tenement for tom jack or richard now i thought very\\nwell of it for three reasons iâ\\x80\\x99ll give you that is to say firstly\\nitâ\\x80\\x99s altogether out of all your beats and is well away from the usual\\nheap of streets great and small secondly without going near it\\nyourself you could always hear of the safety of tom jack or richard\\nthrough mr herbert thirdly after a while and when it might be\\nprudent if you should want to slip tom jack or richard on board a\\nforeign packetboat there he isâ\\x80\\x94readyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nmuch comforted by these considerations i thanked wemmick again and\\nagain and begged him to proceed\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwell sir mr herbert threw himself into the business with a will\\nand by nine oâ\\x80\\x99clock last night he housed tom jack or\\nrichardâ\\x80\\x94whichever it may beâ\\x80\\x94you and i donâ\\x80\\x99t want to knowâ\\x80\\x94quite\\nsuccessfully at the old lodgings it was understood that he was\\nsummoned to dover and in fact he was taken down the dover road and\\ncornered out of it now another great advantage of all this is that\\nit was done without you and when if any one was concerning himself\\nabout your movements you must be known to be ever so many miles off\\nand quite otherwise engaged this diverts suspicion and confuses it\\nand for the same reason i recommended that even if you came back last\\nnight you should not go home it brings in more confusion and you\\nwant confusionâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nwemmick having finished his breakfast here looked at his watch and\\nbegan to get his coat on\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cand now mr pipâ\\x80\\x9d said he with his hands still in the sleeves â\\x80\\x9ci\\nhave probably done the most i can do but if i can ever do moreâ\\x80\\x94from a\\nwalworth point of view and in a strictly private and personal\\ncapacityâ\\x80\\x94i shall be glad to do it hereâ\\x80\\x99s the address there can be no\\nharm in your going here tonight and seeing for yourself that all is\\nwell with tom jack or richard before you go homeâ\\x80\\x94which is another\\nreason for your not going home last night but after you have gone\\nhome donâ\\x80\\x99t go back here you are very welcome i am sure mr pipâ\\x80\\x9d\\nhis hands were now out of his sleeves and i was shaking them â\\x80\\x9cand let\\nme finally impress one important point upon youâ\\x80\\x9d he laid his hands\\nupon my shoulders and added in a solemn whisper â\\x80\\x9cavail yourself of\\nthis evening to lay hold of his portable property you donâ\\x80\\x99t know what\\nmay happen to him donâ\\x80\\x99t let anything happen to the portable propertyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nquite despairing of making my mind clear to wemmick on this point i\\nforbore to try\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ctimeâ\\x80\\x99s upâ\\x80\\x9d said wemmick â\\x80\\x9cand i must be off if you had nothing more\\npressing to do than to keep here till dark thatâ\\x80\\x99s what i should\\nadvise you look very much worried and it would do you good to have a\\nperfectly quiet day with the agedâ\\x80\\x94heâ\\x80\\x99ll be up presentlyâ\\x80\\x94and a little\\nbit ofâ\\x80\\x94you remember the pigâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cof courseâ\\x80\\x9d said i\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwell and a little bit of him that sausage you toasted was his and\\nhe was in all respects a firstrater do try him if it is only for old\\nacquaintance sake goodbye aged parentâ\\x80\\x9d in a cheery shout\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9call right john all right my boyâ\\x80\\x9d piped the old man from within\\n\\ni soon fell asleep before wemmickâ\\x80\\x99s fire and the aged and i enjoyed\\none anotherâ\\x80\\x99s society by falling asleep before it more or less all day\\nwe had loin of pork for dinner and greens grown on the estate and i\\nnodded at the aged with a good intention whenever i failed to do it\\ndrowsily when it was quite dark i left the aged preparing the fire\\nfor toast and i inferred from the number of teacups as well as from\\nhis glances at the two little doors in the wall that miss skiffins was\\nexpected\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter xlvi\\n\\n\\neight oâ\\x80\\x99clock had struck before i got into the air that was scented\\nnot disagreeably by the chips and shavings of the longshore\\nboatbuilders and mast oar and block makers all that waterside\\nregion of the upper and lower pool below bridge was unknown ground to\\nme and when i struck down by the river i found that the spot i wanted\\nwas not where i had supposed it to be and was anything but easy to\\nfind it was called mill pond bank chinksâ\\x80\\x99s basin and i had no other\\nguide to chinksâ\\x80\\x99s basin than the old green copper ropewalk\\n\\nit matters not what stranded ships repairing in dry docks i lost myself\\namong what old hulls of ships in course of being knocked to pieces\\nwhat ooze and slime and other dregs of tide what yards of\\nshipbuilders and shipbreakers what rusty anchors blindly biting into\\nthe ground though for years off duty what mountainous country of\\naccumulated casks and timber how many ropewalks that were not the old\\ngreen copper after several times falling short of my destination and\\nas often overshooting it i came unexpectedly round a corner upon mill\\npond bank it was a fresh kind of place all circumstances considered\\nwhere the wind from the river had room to turn itself round and there\\nwere two or three trees in it and there was the stump of a ruined\\nwindmill and there was the old green copper ropewalkâ\\x80\\x94whose long and\\nnarrow vista i could trace in the moonlight along a series of wooden\\nframes set in the ground that looked like superannuated\\nhaymakingrakes which had grown old and lost most of their teeth\\n\\nselecting from the few queer houses upon mill pond bank a house with a\\nwooden front and three stories of bowwindow not baywindow which is\\nanother thing i looked at the plate upon the door and read there\\nmrs whimple that being the name i wanted i knocked and an elderly\\nwoman of a pleasant and thriving appearance responded she was\\nimmediately deposed however by herbert who silently led me into the\\nparlour and shut the door it was an odd sensation to see his very\\nfamiliar face established quite at home in that very unfamiliar room\\nand region and i found myself looking at him much as i looked at the\\ncornercupboard with the glass and china the shells upon the\\nchimneypiece and the coloured engravings on the wall representing\\nthe death of captain cook a shiplaunch and his majesty king george\\nthe third in a state coachmanâ\\x80\\x99s wig leatherbreeches and topboots\\non the terrace at windsor\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9call is well handelâ\\x80\\x9d said herbert â\\x80\\x9cand he is quite satisfied though\\neager to see you my dear girl is with her father and if youâ\\x80\\x99ll wait\\ntill she comes down iâ\\x80\\x99ll make you known to her and then weâ\\x80\\x99ll go\\nupstairs thatâ\\x80\\x99s her fatherâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni had become aware of an alarming growling overhead and had probably\\nexpressed the fact in my countenance\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci am afraid he is a sad old rascalâ\\x80\\x9d said herbert smiling â\\x80\\x9cbut i\\nhave never seen him donâ\\x80\\x99t you smell rum he is always at itâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cat rumâ\\x80\\x9d said i\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyesâ\\x80\\x9d returned herbert â\\x80\\x9cand you may suppose how mild it makes his\\ngout he persists too in keeping all the provisions upstairs in his\\nroom and serving them out he keeps them on shelves over his head and\\nwill weigh them all his room must be like a chandlerâ\\x80\\x99s shopâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nwhile he thus spoke the growling noise became a prolonged roar and\\nthen died away\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhat else can be the consequenceâ\\x80\\x9d said herbert in explanation â\\x80\\x9cif\\nhe will cut the cheese a man with the gout in his right handâ\\x80\\x94and\\neverywhere elseâ\\x80\\x94canâ\\x80\\x99t expect to get through a double gloucester without\\nhurting himselfâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nhe seemed to have hurt himself very much for he gave another furious\\nroar\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cto have provis for an upper lodger is quite a godsend to mrs\\nwhimpleâ\\x80\\x9d said herbert â\\x80\\x9cfor of course people in general wonâ\\x80\\x99t stand\\nthat noise a curious place handel isnâ\\x80\\x99t itâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nit was a curious place indeed but remarkably well kept and clean\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmrs whimpleâ\\x80\\x9d said herbert when i told him so â\\x80\\x9cis the best of\\nhousewives and i really do not know what my clara would do without her\\nmotherly help for clara has no mother of her own handel and no\\nrelation in the world but old gruffandgrimâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9csurely thatâ\\x80\\x99s not his name herbertâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cno noâ\\x80\\x9d said herbert â\\x80\\x9cthatâ\\x80\\x99s my name for him his name is mr\\nbarley but what a blessing it is for the son of my father and mother\\nto love a girl who has no relations and who can never bother herself\\nor anybody else about her familyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nherbert had told me on former occasions and now reminded me that he\\nfirst knew miss clara barley when she was completing her education at\\nan establishment at hammersmith and that on her being recalled home to\\nnurse her father he and she had confided their affection to the\\nmotherly mrs whimple by whom it had been fostered and regulated with\\nequal kindness and discretion ever since it was understood that\\nnothing of a tender nature could possibly be confided to old barley by\\nreason of his being totally unequal to the consideration of any subject\\nmore psychological than gout rum and purserâ\\x80\\x99s stores\\n\\nas we were thus conversing in a low tone while old barleyâ\\x80\\x99s sustained\\ngrowl vibrated in the beam that crossed the ceiling the room door\\nopened and a very pretty slight darkeyed girl of twenty or so came\\nin with a basket in her hand whom herbert tenderly relieved of the\\nbasket and presented blushing as â\\x80\\x9cclaraâ\\x80\\x9d she really was a most\\ncharming girl and might have passed for a captive fairy whom that\\ntruculent ogre old barley had pressed into his service\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9clook hereâ\\x80\\x9d said herbert showing me the basket with a compassionate\\nand tender smile after we had talked a little â\\x80\\x9chereâ\\x80\\x99s poor claraâ\\x80\\x99s\\nsupper served out every night hereâ\\x80\\x99s her allowance of bread and\\nhereâ\\x80\\x99s her slice of cheese and hereâ\\x80\\x99s her rumâ\\x80\\x94which i drink this is\\nmr barleyâ\\x80\\x99s breakfast for tomorrow served out to be cooked two\\nmuttonchops three potatoes some split peas a little flour two\\nounces of butter a pinch of salt and all this black pepper itâ\\x80\\x99s\\nstewed up together and taken hot and itâ\\x80\\x99s a nice thing for the gout\\ni should thinkâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthere was something so natural and winning in claraâ\\x80\\x99s resigned way of\\nlooking at these stores in detail as herbert pointed them out and\\nsomething so confiding loving and innocent in her modest manner of\\nyielding herself to herbertâ\\x80\\x99s embracing arm and something so gentle in\\nher so much needing protection on mill pond bank by chinksâ\\x80\\x99s basin\\nand the old green copper ropewalk with old barley growling in the\\nbeamâ\\x80\\x94that i would not have undone the engagement between her and\\nherbert for all the money in the pocketbook i had never opened\\n\\ni was looking at her with pleasure and admiration when suddenly the\\ngrowl swelled into a roar again and a frightful bumping noise was\\nheard above as if a giant with a wooden leg were trying to bore it\\nthrough the ceiling to come at us upon this clara said to herbert\\nâ\\x80\\x9cpapa wants me darlingâ\\x80\\x9d and ran away\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthere is an unconscionable old shark for youâ\\x80\\x9d said herbert â\\x80\\x9cwhat do\\nyou suppose he wants now handelâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci donâ\\x80\\x99t knowâ\\x80\\x9d said i â\\x80\\x9csomething to drinkâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthatâ\\x80\\x99s itâ\\x80\\x9d cried herbert as if i had made a guess of extraordinary\\nmerit â\\x80\\x9che keeps his grog ready mixed in a little tub on the table\\nwait a moment and youâ\\x80\\x99ll hear clara lift him up to take some there he\\ngoesâ\\x80\\x9d another roar with a prolonged shake at the end â\\x80\\x9cnowâ\\x80\\x9d said\\nherbert as it was succeeded by silence â\\x80\\x9cheâ\\x80\\x99s drinking nowâ\\x80\\x9d said\\nherbert as the growl resounded in the beam once more â\\x80\\x9cheâ\\x80\\x99s down again\\non his backâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nclara returned soon afterwards and herbert accompanied me upstairs to\\nsee our charge as we passed mr barleyâ\\x80\\x99s door he was heard hoarsely\\nmuttering within in a strain that rose and fell like wind the\\nfollowing refrain in which i substitute good wishes for something\\nquite the reverseâ\\x80\\x94\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cahoy bless your eyes hereâ\\x80\\x99s old bill barley hereâ\\x80\\x99s old bill barley\\nbless your eyes hereâ\\x80\\x99s old bill barley on the flat of his back by the\\nlord lying on the flat of his back like a drifting old dead flounder\\nhereâ\\x80\\x99s your old bill barley bless your eyes ahoy bless youâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nin this strain of consolation herbert informed me the invisible barley\\nwould commune with himself by the day and night together often while\\nit was light having at the same time one eye at a telescope which\\nwas fitted on his bed for the convenience of sweeping the river\\n\\nin his two cabin rooms at the top of the house which were fresh and\\nairy and in which mr barley was less audible than below i found\\nprovis comfortably settled he expressed no alarm and seemed to feel\\nnone that was worth mentioning but it struck me that he was\\nsoftenedâ\\x80\\x94indefinably for i could not have said how and could never\\nafterwards recall how when i tried but certainly\\n\\nthe opportunity that the dayâ\\x80\\x99s rest had given me for reflection had\\nresulted in my fully determining to say nothing to him respecting\\ncompeyson for anything i knew his animosity towards the man might\\notherwise lead to his seeking him out and rushing on his own\\ndestruction therefore when herbert and i sat down with him by his\\nfire i asked him first of all whether he relied on wemmickâ\\x80\\x99s judgment\\nand sources of information\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cay ay dear boyâ\\x80\\x9d he answered with a grave nod â\\x80\\x9cjaggers knowsâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthen i have talked with wemmickâ\\x80\\x9d said i â\\x80\\x9cand have come to tell you\\nwhat caution he gave me and what adviceâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthis i did accurately with the reservation just mentioned and i told\\nhim how wemmick had heard in newgate prison whether from officers or\\nprisoners i could not say that he was under some suspicion and that\\nmy chambers had been watched how wemmick had recommended his keeping\\nclose for a time and my keeping away from him and what wemmick had\\nsaid about getting him abroad i added that of course when the time\\ncame i should go with him or should follow close upon him as might\\nbe safest in wemmickâ\\x80\\x99s judgment what was to follow that i did not\\ntouch upon neither indeed was i at all clear or comfortable about it\\nin my own mind now that i saw him in that softer condition and in\\ndeclared peril for my sake as to altering my way of living by\\nenlarging my expenses i put it to him whether in our present unsettled\\nand difficult circumstances it would not be simply ridiculous if it\\nwere no worse\\n\\nhe could not deny this and indeed was very reasonable throughout his\\ncoming back was a venture he said and he had always known it to be a\\nventure he would do nothing to make it a desperate venture and he had\\nvery little fear of his safety with such good help\\n\\nherbert who had been looking at the fire and pondering here said that\\nsomething had come into his thoughts arising out of wemmickâ\\x80\\x99s\\nsuggestion which it might be worth while to pursue â\\x80\\x9cwe are both good\\nwatermen handel and could take him down the river ourselves when the\\nright time comes no boat would then be hired for the purpose and no\\nboatmen that would save at least a chance of suspicion and any chance\\nis worth saving never mind the season donâ\\x80\\x99t you think it might be a\\ngood thing if you began at once to keep a boat at the temple stairs\\nand were in the habit of rowing up and down the river you fall into\\nthat habit and then who notices or minds do it twenty or fifty times\\nand there is nothing special in your doing it the twentyfirst or\\nfiftyfirstâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni liked this scheme and provis was quite elated by it we agreed that\\nit should be carried into execution and that provis should never\\nrecognise us if we came below bridge and rowed past mill pond bank\\nbut we further agreed that he should pull down the blind in that part\\nof his window which gave upon the east whenever he saw us and all was\\nright\\n\\nour conference being now ended and everything arranged i rose to go\\nremarking to herbert that he and i had better not go home together and\\nthat i would take half an hourâ\\x80\\x99s start of him â\\x80\\x9ci donâ\\x80\\x99t like to leave\\nyou hereâ\\x80\\x9d i said to provis â\\x80\\x9cthough i cannot doubt your being safer\\nhere than near me goodbyeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cdear boyâ\\x80\\x9d he answered clasping my hands â\\x80\\x9ci donâ\\x80\\x99t know when we may\\nmeet again and i donâ\\x80\\x99t like goodbye say goodnightâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cgoodnight herbert will go regularly between us and when the time\\ncomes you may be certain i shall be ready goodnight goodnightâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nwe thought it best that he should stay in his own rooms and we left\\nhim on the landing outside his door holding a light over the\\nstairrail to light us downstairs looking back at him i thought of\\nthe first night of his return when our positions were reversed and\\nwhen i little supposed my heart could ever be as heavy and anxious at\\nparting from him as it was now\\n\\nold barley was growling and swearing when we repassed his door with no\\nappearance of having ceased or of meaning to cease when we got to the\\nfoot of the stairs i asked herbert whether he had preserved the name\\nof provis he replied certainly not and that the lodger was mr\\ncampbell he also explained that the utmost known of mr campbell there\\nwas that he herbert had mr campbell consigned to him and felt a\\nstrong personal interest in his being well cared for and living a\\nsecluded life so when we went into the parlour where mrs whimple and\\nclara were seated at work i said nothing of my own interest in mr\\ncampbell but kept it to myself\\n\\nwhen i had taken leave of the pretty gentle darkeyed girl and of\\nthe motherly woman who had not outlived her honest sympathy with a\\nlittle affair of true love i felt as if the old green copper ropewalk\\nhad grown quite a different place old barley might be as old as the\\nhills and might swear like a whole field of troopers but there were\\nredeeming youth and trust and hope enough in chinksâ\\x80\\x99s basin to fill it\\nto overflowing and then i thought of estella and of our parting and\\nwent home very sadly\\n\\nall things were as quiet in the temple as ever i had seen them the\\nwindows of the rooms on that side lately occupied by provis were dark\\nand still and there was no lounger in garden court i walked past the\\nfountain twice or thrice before i descended the steps that were between\\nme and my rooms but i was quite alone herbert coming to my bedside\\nwhen he came inâ\\x80\\x94for i went straight to bed dispirited and\\nfatiguedâ\\x80\\x94made the same report opening one of the windows after that\\nhe looked out into the moonlight and told me that the pavement was as\\nsolemnly empty as the pavement of any cathedral at that same hour\\n\\nnext day i set myself to get the boat it was soon done and the boat\\nwas brought round to the temple stairs and lay where i could reach her\\nwithin a minute or two then i began to go out as for training and\\npractice sometimes alone sometimes with herbert i was often out in\\ncold rain and sleet but nobody took much note of me after i had been\\nout a few times at first i kept above blackfriars bridge but as the\\nhours of the tide changed i took towards london bridge it was old\\nlondon bridge in those days and at certain states of the tide there\\nwas a race and fall of water there which gave it a bad reputation but\\ni knew well enough how to â\\x80\\x98shootâ\\x80\\x99 the bridge after seeing it done and\\nso began to row about among the shipping in the pool and down to\\nerith the first time i passed mill pond bank herbert and i were\\npulling a pair of oars and both in going and returning we saw the\\nblind towards the east come down herbert was rarely there less\\nfrequently than three times in a week and he never brought me a single\\nword of intelligence that was at all alarming still i knew that there\\nwas cause for alarm and i could not get rid of the notion of being\\nwatched once received it is a haunting idea how many undesigning\\npersons i suspected of watching me it would be hard to calculate\\n\\nin short i was always full of fears for the rash man who was in\\nhiding herbert had sometimes said to me that he found it pleasant to\\nstand at one of our windows after dark when the tide was running down\\nand to think that it was flowing with everything it bore towards\\nclara but i thought with dread that it was flowing towards magwitch\\nand that any black mark on its surface might be his pursuers going\\nswiftly silently and surely to take him\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter xlvii\\n\\n\\nsome weeks passed without bringing any change we waited for wemmick\\nand he made no sign if i had never known him out of little britain\\nand had never enjoyed the privilege of being on a familiar footing at\\nthe castle i might have doubted him not so for a moment knowing him\\nas i did\\n\\nmy worldly affairs began to wear a gloomy appearance and i was pressed\\nfor money by more than one creditor even i myself began to know the\\nwant of money i mean of ready money in my own pocket and to relieve\\nit by converting some easily spared articles of jewelery into cash but\\ni had quite determined that it would be a heartless fraud to take more\\nmoney from my patron in the existing state of my uncertain thoughts and\\nplans therefore i had sent him the unopened pocketbook by herbert\\nto hold in his own keeping and i felt a kind of satisfactionâ\\x80\\x94whether\\nit was a false kind or a true i hardly knowâ\\x80\\x94in not having profited by\\nhis generosity since his revelation of himself\\n\\nas the time wore on an impression settled heavily upon me that estella\\nwas married fearful of having it confirmed though it was all but a\\nconviction i avoided the newspapers and begged herbert to whom i had\\nconfided the circumstances of our last interview never to speak of her\\nto me why i hoarded up this last wretched little rag of the robe of\\nhope that was rent and given to the winds how do i know why did you\\nwho read this commit that not dissimilar inconsistency of your own\\nlast year last month last week\\n\\nit was an unhappy life that i lived and its one dominant anxiety\\ntowering over all its other anxieties like a high mountain above a\\nrange of mountains never disappeared from my view still no new cause\\nfor fear arose let me start from my bed as i would with the terror\\nfresh upon me that he was discovered let me sit listening as i would\\nwith dread for herbertâ\\x80\\x99s returning step at night lest it should be\\nfleeter than ordinary and winged with evil newsâ\\x80\\x94for all that and\\nmuch more to like purpose the round of things went on condemned to\\ninaction and a state of constant restlessness and suspense i rowed\\nabout in my boat and waited waited waited as i best could\\n\\nthere were states of the tide when having been down the river i could\\nnot get back through the eddychafed arches and starlings of old london\\nbridge then i left my boat at a wharf near the custom house to be\\nbrought up afterwards to the temple stairs i was not averse to doing\\nthis as it served to make me and my boat a commoner incident among the\\nwaterside people there from this slight occasion sprang two meetings\\nthat i have now to tell of\\n\\none afternoon late in the month of february i came ashore at the\\nwharf at dusk i had pulled down as far as greenwich with the ebb tide\\nand had turned with the tide it had been a fine bright day but had\\nbecome foggy as the sun dropped and i had had to feel my way back\\namong the shipping pretty carefully both in going and returning i\\nhad seen the signal in his window all well\\n\\nas it was a raw evening and i was cold i thought i would comfort\\nmyself with dinner at once and as i had hours of dejection and\\nsolitude before me if i went home to the temple i thought i would\\nafterwards go to the play the theatre where mr wopsle had achieved\\nhis questionable triumph was in that waterside neighbourhood it is\\nnowhere now and to that theatre i resolved to go i was aware that\\nmr wopsle had not succeeded in reviving the drama but on the\\ncontrary had rather partaken of its decline he had been ominously\\nheard of through the playbills as a faithful black in connection\\nwith a little girl of noble birth and a monkey and herbert had seen\\nhim as a predatory tartar of comic propensities with a face like a red\\nbrick and an outrageous hat all over bells\\n\\ni dined at what herbert and i used to call a geographical chophouse\\nwhere there were maps of the world in porterpot rims on every\\nhalfyard of the tablecloths and charts of gravy on every one of the\\nknivesâ\\x80\\x94to this day there is scarcely a single chophouse within the\\nlord mayorâ\\x80\\x99s dominions which is not geographicalâ\\x80\\x94and wore out the time\\nin dozing over crumbs staring at gas and baking in a hot blast of\\ndinners by and by i roused myself and went to the play\\n\\nthere i found a virtuous boatswain in his majestyâ\\x80\\x99s serviceâ\\x80\\x94a most\\nexcellent man though i could have wished his trousers not quite so\\ntight in some places and not quite so loose in othersâ\\x80\\x94who knocked all\\nthe little menâ\\x80\\x99s hats over their eyes though he was very generous and\\nbrave and who wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t hear of anybodyâ\\x80\\x99s paying taxes though he was\\nvery patriotic he had a bag of money in his pocket like a pudding in\\nthe cloth and on that property married a young person in\\nbedfurniture with great rejoicings the whole population of\\nportsmouth nine in number at the last census turning out on the beach\\nto rub their own hands and shake everybody elseâ\\x80\\x99s and sing â\\x80\\x9cfill\\nfillâ\\x80\\x9d a certain darkcomplexioned swab however who wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t fill or\\ndo anything else that was proposed to him and whose heart was openly\\nstated by the boatswain to be as black as his figurehead proposed\\nto two other swabs to get all mankind into difficulties which was so\\neffectually done the swab family having considerable political\\ninfluence that it took half the evening to set things right and then\\nit was only brought about through an honest little grocer with a white\\nhat black gaiters and red nose getting into a clock with a\\ngridiron and listening and coming out and knocking everybody down\\nfrom behind with the gridiron whom he couldnâ\\x80\\x99t confute with what he had\\noverheard this led to mr wopsleâ\\x80\\x99s who had never been heard of\\nbefore coming in with a star and garter on as a plenipotentiary of\\ngreat power direct from the admiralty to say that the swabs were all\\nto go to prison on the spot and that he had brought the boatswain down\\nthe union jack as a slight acknowledgment of his public services the\\nboatswain unmanned for the first time respectfully dried his eyes on\\nthe jack and then cheering up and addressing mr wopsle as your\\nhonour solicited permission to take him by the fin mr wopsle\\nconceding his fin with a gracious dignity was immediately shoved into\\na dusty corner while everybody danced a hornpipe and from that\\ncorner surveying the public with a discontented eye became aware of\\nme\\n\\nthe second piece was the last new grand comic christmas pantomime in\\nthe first scene of which it pained me to suspect that i detected mr\\nwopsle with red worsted legs under a highly magnified phosphoric\\ncountenance and a shock of red curtainfringe for his hair engaged in\\nthe manufacture of thunderbolts in a mine and displaying great\\ncowardice when his gigantic master came home very hoarse to dinner\\nbut he presently presented himself under worthier circumstances for\\nthe genius of youthful love being in want of assistanceâ\\x80\\x94on account of\\nthe parental brutality of an ignorant farmer who opposed the choice of\\nhis daughterâ\\x80\\x99s heart by purposely falling upon the object in a\\nfloursack out of the firstfloor windowâ\\x80\\x94summoned a sententious\\nenchanter and he coming up from the antipodes rather unsteadily\\nafter an apparently violent journey proved to be mr wopsle in a\\nhighcrowned hat with a necromantic work in one volume under his arm\\nthe business of this enchanter on earth being principally to be talked\\nat sung at butted at danced at and flashed at with fires of various\\ncolours he had a good deal of time on his hands and i observed with\\ngreat surprise that he devoted it to staring in my direction as if he\\nwere lost in amazement\\n\\nthere was something so remarkable in the increasing glare of mr\\nwopsleâ\\x80\\x99s eye and he seemed to be turning so many things over in his\\nmind and to grow so confused that i could not make it out i sat\\nthinking of it long after he had ascended to the clouds in a large\\nwatchcase and still i could not make it out i was still thinking of\\nit when i came out of the theatre an hour afterwards and found him\\nwaiting for me near the door\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9chow do you doâ\\x80\\x9d said i shaking hands with him as we turned down the\\nstreet together â\\x80\\x9ci saw that you saw meâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9csaw you mr pipâ\\x80\\x9d he returned â\\x80\\x9cyes of course i saw you but who\\nelse was thereâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwho elseâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cit is the strangest thingâ\\x80\\x9d said mr wopsle drifting into his lost\\nlook again â\\x80\\x9cand yet i could swear to himâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nbecoming alarmed i entreated mr wopsle to explain his meaning\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhether i should have noticed him at first but for your being thereâ\\x80\\x9d\\nsaid mr wopsle going on in the same lost way â\\x80\\x9ci canâ\\x80\\x99t be positive\\nyet i think i shouldâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ninvoluntarily i looked round me as i was accustomed to look round me\\nwhen i went home for these mysterious words gave me a chill\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9coh he canâ\\x80\\x99t be in sightâ\\x80\\x9d said mr wopsle â\\x80\\x9che went out before i went\\noff i saw him goâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nhaving the reason that i had for being suspicious i even suspected\\nthis poor actor i mistrusted a design to entrap me into some\\nadmission therefore i glanced at him as we walked on together but\\nsaid nothing\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci had a ridiculous fancy that he must be with you mr pip till i saw\\nthat you were quite unconscious of him sitting behind you there like a\\nghostâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nmy former chill crept over me again but i was resolved not to speak\\nyet for it was quite consistent with his words that he might be set on\\nto induce me to connect these references with provis of course i was\\nperfectly sure and safe that provis had not been there\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci dare say you wonder at me mr pip indeed i see you do but it is\\nso very strange youâ\\x80\\x99ll hardly believe what i am going to tell you i\\ncould hardly believe it myself if you told meâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cindeedâ\\x80\\x9d said i\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cno indeed mr pip you remember in old times a certain christmas\\nday when you were quite a child and i dined at gargeryâ\\x80\\x99s and some\\nsoldiers came to the door to get a pair of handcuffs mendedâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci remember it very wellâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cand you remember that there was a chase after two convicts and that\\nwe joined in it and that gargery took you on his back and that i took\\nthe lead and you kept up with me as well as you couldâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci remember it all very wellâ\\x80\\x9d better than he thoughtâ\\x80\\x94except the last\\nclause\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cand you remember that we came up with the two in a ditch and that\\nthere was a scuffle between them and that one of them had been\\nseverely handled and much mauled about the face by the otherâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci see it all before meâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cand that the soldiers lighted torches and put the two in the centre\\nand that we went on to see the last of them over the black marshes\\nwith the torchlight shining on their facesâ\\x80\\x94i am particular about\\nthatâ\\x80\\x94with the torchlight shining on their faces when there was an\\nouter ring of dark night all about usâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyesâ\\x80\\x9d said i â\\x80\\x9ci remember all thatâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthen mr pip one of those two prisoners sat behind you tonight i\\nsaw him over your shoulderâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9csteadyâ\\x80\\x9d i thought i asked him then â\\x80\\x9cwhich of the two do you suppose\\nyou sawâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthe one who had been mauledâ\\x80\\x9d he answered readily â\\x80\\x9cand iâ\\x80\\x99ll swear i\\nsaw him the more i think of him the more certain i am of himâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthis is very curiousâ\\x80\\x9d said i with the best assumption i could put on\\nof its being nothing more to me â\\x80\\x9cvery curious indeedâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni cannot exaggerate the enhanced disquiet into which this conversation\\nthrew me or the special and peculiar terror i felt at compeysonâ\\x80\\x99s\\nhaving been behind me â\\x80\\x9clike a ghostâ\\x80\\x9d for if he had ever been out of my\\nthoughts for a few moments together since the hiding had begun it was\\nin those very moments when he was closest to me and to think that i\\nshould be so unconscious and off my guard after all my care was as if i\\nhad shut an avenue of a hundred doors to keep him out and then had\\nfound him at my elbow i could not doubt either that he was there\\nbecause i was there and that however slight an appearance of danger\\nthere might be about us danger was always near and active\\n\\ni put such questions to mr wopsle as when did the man come in he\\ncould not tell me that he saw me and over my shoulder he saw the man\\nit was not until he had seen him for some time that he began to\\nidentify him but he had from the first vaguely associated him with me\\nand known him as somehow belonging to me in the old village time how\\nwas he dressed prosperously but not noticeably otherwise he thought\\nin black was his face at all disfigured no he believed not i\\nbelieved not too for although in my brooding state i had taken no\\nespecial notice of the people behind me i thought it likely that a\\nface at all disfigured would have attracted my attention\\n\\nwhen mr wopsle had imparted to me all that he could recall or i\\nextract and when i had treated him to a little appropriate\\nrefreshment after the fatigues of the evening we parted it was\\nbetween twelve and one oâ\\x80\\x99clock when i reached the temple and the gates\\nwere shut no one was near me when i went in and went home\\n\\nherbert had come in and we held a very serious council by the fire\\nbut there was nothing to be done saving to communicate to wemmick what\\ni had that night found out and to remind him that we waited for his\\nhint as i thought that i might compromise him if i went too often to\\nthe castle i made this communication by letter i wrote it before i\\nwent to bed and went out and posted it and again no one was near me\\nherbert and i agreed that we could do nothing else but be very\\ncautious and we were very cautious indeedâ\\x80\\x94more cautious than before\\nif that were possibleâ\\x80\\x94and i for my part never went near chinksâ\\x80\\x99s\\nbasin except when i rowed by and then i only looked at mill pond bank\\nas i looked at anything else\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter xlviii\\n\\n\\nthe second of the two meetings referred to in the last chapter occurred\\nabout a week after the first i had again left my boat at the wharf\\nbelow bridge the time was an hour earlier in the afternoon and\\nundecided where to dine i had strolled up into cheapside and was\\nstrolling along it surely the most unsettled person in all the busy\\nconcourse when a large hand was laid upon my shoulder by some one\\novertaking me it was mr jaggersâ\\x80\\x99s hand and he passed it through my\\narm\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cas we are going in the same direction pip we may walk together\\nwhere are you bound forâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cfor the temple i thinkâ\\x80\\x9d said i\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cdonâ\\x80\\x99t you knowâ\\x80\\x9d said mr jaggers\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwellâ\\x80\\x9d i returned glad for once to get the better of him in\\ncrossexamination â\\x80\\x9ci do not know for i have not made up my mindâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou are going to dineâ\\x80\\x9d said mr jaggers â\\x80\\x9cyou donâ\\x80\\x99t mind admitting\\nthat i supposeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnoâ\\x80\\x9d i returned â\\x80\\x9ci donâ\\x80\\x99t mind admitting thatâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cand are not engagedâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci donâ\\x80\\x99t mind admitting also that i am not engagedâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthenâ\\x80\\x9d said mr jaggers â\\x80\\x9ccome and dine with meâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni was going to excuse myself when he added â\\x80\\x9cwemmickâ\\x80\\x99s comingâ\\x80\\x9d so i\\nchanged my excuse into an acceptanceâ\\x80\\x94the few words i had uttered\\nserving for the beginning of eitherâ\\x80\\x94and we went along cheapside and\\nslanted off to little britain while the lights were springing up\\nbrilliantly in the shop windows and the street lamplighters scarcely\\nfinding ground enough to plant their ladders on in the midst of the\\nafternoonâ\\x80\\x99s bustle were skipping up and down and running in and out\\nopening more red eyes in the gathering fog than my rushlight tower at\\nthe hummums had opened white eyes in the ghostly wall\\n\\nat the office in little britain there was the usual letterwriting\\nhandwashing candlesnuffing and safelocking that closed the\\nbusiness of the day as i stood idle by mr jaggersâ\\x80\\x99s fire its rising\\nand falling flame made the two casts on the shelf look as if they were\\nplaying a diabolical game at bopeep with me while the pair of coarse\\nfat office candles that dimly lighted mr jaggers as he wrote in a\\ncorner were decorated with dirty windingsheets as if in remembrance\\nof a host of hanged clients\\n\\nwe went to gerrard street all three together in a hackneycoach and\\nas soon as we got there dinner was served although i should not have\\nthought of making in that place the most distant reference by so much\\nas a look to wemmickâ\\x80\\x99s walworth sentiments yet i should have had no\\nobjection to catching his eye now and then in a friendly way but it\\nwas not to be done he turned his eyes on mr jaggers whenever he\\nraised them from the table and was as dry and distant to me as if\\nthere were twin wemmicks and this was the wrong one\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cdid you send that note of miss havishamâ\\x80\\x99s to mr pip wemmickâ\\x80\\x9d mr\\njaggers asked soon after we began dinner\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cno sirâ\\x80\\x9d returned wemmick â\\x80\\x9cit was going by post when you brought\\nmr pip into the office here it isâ\\x80\\x9d he handed it to his principal\\ninstead of to me\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s a note of two lines pipâ\\x80\\x9d said mr jaggers handing it on â\\x80\\x9csent\\nup to me by miss havisham on account of her not being sure of your\\naddress she tells me that she wants to see you on a little matter of\\nbusiness you mentioned to her youâ\\x80\\x99ll go downâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyesâ\\x80\\x9d said i casting my eyes over the note which was exactly in\\nthose terms\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhen do you think of going downâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci have an impending engagementâ\\x80\\x9d said i glancing at wemmick who was\\nputting fish into the postoffice â\\x80\\x9cthat renders me rather uncertain of\\nmy time at once i thinkâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cif mr pip has the intention of going at onceâ\\x80\\x9d said wemmick to mr\\njaggers â\\x80\\x9che neednâ\\x80\\x99t write an answer you knowâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nreceiving this as an intimation that it was best not to delay i\\nsettled that i would go tomorrow and said so wemmick drank a glass\\nof wine and looked with a grimly satisfied air at mr jaggers but not\\nat me\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cso pip our friend the spiderâ\\x80\\x9d said mr jaggers â\\x80\\x9chas played his\\ncards he has won the poolâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nit was as much as i could do to assent\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9chah he is a promising fellowâ\\x80\\x94in his wayâ\\x80\\x94but he may not have it all\\nhis own way the stronger will win in the end but the stronger has to\\nbe found out first if he should turn to and beat herâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9csurelyâ\\x80\\x9d i interrupted with a burning face and heart â\\x80\\x9cyou do not\\nseriously think that he is scoundrel enough for that mr jaggersâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci didnâ\\x80\\x99t say so pip i am putting a case if he should turn to and\\nbeat her he may possibly get the strength on his side if it should be\\na question of intellect he certainly will not it would be chance work\\nto give an opinion how a fellow of that sort will turn out in such\\ncircumstances because itâ\\x80\\x99s a tossup between two resultsâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmay i ask what they areâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ca fellow like our friend the spiderâ\\x80\\x9d answered mr jaggers â\\x80\\x9ceither\\nbeats or cringes he may cringe and growl or cringe and not growl but\\nhe either beats or cringes ask wemmick his opinionâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ceither beats or cringesâ\\x80\\x9d said wemmick not at all addressing himself\\nto me\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cso hereâ\\x80\\x99s to mrs bentley drummleâ\\x80\\x9d said mr jaggers taking a\\ndecanter of choicer wine from his dumbwaiter and filling for each of\\nus and for himself â\\x80\\x9cand may the question of supremacy be settled to\\nthe ladyâ\\x80\\x99s satisfaction to the satisfaction of the lady and the\\ngentleman it never will be now molly molly molly molly how slow\\nyou are todayâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nshe was at his elbow when he addressed her putting a dish upon the\\ntable as she withdrew her hands from it she fell back a step or two\\nnervously muttering some excuse and a certain action of her fingers\\nas she spoke arrested my attention\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhatâ\\x80\\x99s the matterâ\\x80\\x9d said mr jaggers\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnothing only the subject we were speaking ofâ\\x80\\x9d said i â\\x80\\x9cwas rather\\npainful to meâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthe action of her fingers was like the action of knitting she stood\\nlooking at her master not understanding whether she was free to go or\\nwhether he had more to say to her and would call her back if she did\\ngo her look was very intent surely i had seen exactly such eyes and\\nsuch hands on a memorable occasion very lately\\n\\nhe dismissed her and she glided out of the room but she remained\\nbefore me as plainly as if she were still there i looked at those\\nhands i looked at those eyes i looked at that flowing hair and i\\ncompared them with other hands other eyes other hair that i knew of\\nand with what those might be after twenty years of a brutal husband and\\na stormy life i looked again at those hands and eyes of the\\nhousekeeper and thought of the inexplicable feeling that had come over\\nme when i last walkedâ\\x80\\x94not aloneâ\\x80\\x94in the ruined garden and through the\\ndeserted brewery i thought how the same feeling had come back when i\\nsaw a face looking at me and a hand waving to me from a stagecoach\\nwindow and how it had come back again and had flashed about me like\\nlightning when i had passed in a carriageâ\\x80\\x94not aloneâ\\x80\\x94through a sudden\\nglare of light in a dark street i thought how one link of association\\nhad helped that identification in the theatre and how such a link\\nwanting before had been riveted for me now when i had passed by a\\nchance swift from estellaâ\\x80\\x99s name to the fingers with their knitting\\naction and the attentive eyes and i felt absolutely certain that this\\nwoman was estellaâ\\x80\\x99s mother\\n\\nmr jaggers had seen me with estella and was not likely to have missed\\nthe sentiments i had been at no pains to conceal he nodded when i said\\nthe subject was painful to me clapped me on the back put round the\\nwine again and went on with his dinner\\n\\nonly twice more did the housekeeper reappear and then her stay in the\\nroom was very short and mr jaggers was sharp with her but her hands\\nwere estellaâ\\x80\\x99s hands and her eyes were estellaâ\\x80\\x99s eyes and if she had\\nreappeared a hundred times i could have been neither more sure nor less\\nsure that my conviction was the truth\\n\\nit was a dull evening for wemmick drew his wine when it came round\\nquite as a matter of businessâ\\x80\\x94just as he might have drawn his salary\\nwhen that came roundâ\\x80\\x94and with his eyes on his chief sat in a state of\\nperpetual readiness for crossexamination as to the quantity of wine\\nhis postoffice was as indifferent and ready as any other postoffice\\nfor its quantity of letters from my point of view he was the wrong\\ntwin all the time and only externally like the wemmick of walworth\\n\\nwe took our leave early and left together even when we were groping\\namong mr jaggersâ\\x80\\x99s stock of boots for our hats i felt that the right\\ntwin was on his way back and we had not gone half a dozen yards down\\ngerrard street in the walworth direction before i found that i was\\nwalking arm in arm with the right twin and that the wrong twin had\\nevaporated into the evening air\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwellâ\\x80\\x9d said wemmick â\\x80\\x9cthatâ\\x80\\x99s over heâ\\x80\\x99s a wonderful man without his\\nliving likeness but i feel that i have to screw myself up when i dine\\nwith himâ\\x80\\x94and i dine more comfortably unscrewedâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni felt that this was a good statement of the case and told him so\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwouldnâ\\x80\\x99t say it to anybody but yourselfâ\\x80\\x9d he answered â\\x80\\x9ci know that\\nwhat is said between you and me goes no furtherâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni asked him if he had ever seen miss havishamâ\\x80\\x99s adopted daughter mrs\\nbentley drummle he said no to avoid being too abrupt i then spoke of\\nthe aged and of miss skiffins he looked rather sly when i mentioned\\nmiss skiffins and stopped in the street to blow his nose with a roll\\nof the head and a flourish not quite free from latent boastfulness\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwemmickâ\\x80\\x9d said i â\\x80\\x9cdo you remember telling me before i first went to\\nmr jaggersâ\\x80\\x99s private house to notice that housekeeperâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cdid iâ\\x80\\x9d he replied â\\x80\\x9cah i dare say i did deuce take meâ\\x80\\x9d he added\\nsuddenly â\\x80\\x9ci know i did i find i am not quite unscrewed yetâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ca wild beast tamed you called herâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cand what do you call herâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthe same how did mr jaggers tame her wemmickâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthatâ\\x80\\x99s his secret she has been with him many a long yearâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci wish you would tell me her story i feel a particular interest in\\nbeing acquainted with it you know that what is said between you and me\\ngoes no furtherâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwellâ\\x80\\x9d wemmick replied â\\x80\\x9ci donâ\\x80\\x99t know her storyâ\\x80\\x94that is i donâ\\x80\\x99t know\\nall of it but what i do know iâ\\x80\\x99ll tell you we are in our private and\\npersonal capacities of courseâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cof courseâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ca score or so of years ago that woman was tried at the old bailey for\\nmurder and was acquitted she was a very handsome young woman and i\\nbelieve had some gypsy blood in her anyhow it was hot enough when it\\nwas up as you may supposeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbut she was acquittedâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmr jaggers was for herâ\\x80\\x9d pursued wemmick with a look full of\\nmeaning â\\x80\\x9cand worked the case in a way quite astonishing it was a\\ndesperate case and it was comparatively early days with him then and\\nhe worked it to general admiration in fact it may almost be said to\\nhave made him he worked it himself at the policeoffice day after day\\nfor many days contending against even a committal and at the trial\\nwhere he couldnâ\\x80\\x99t work it himself sat under counsel andâ\\x80\\x94every one\\nknewâ\\x80\\x94put in all the salt and pepper the murdered person was a womanâ\\x80\\x94a\\nwoman a good ten years older very much larger and very much stronger\\nit was a case of jealousy they both led tramping lives and this woman\\nin gerrard street here had been married very young over the broomstick\\nas we say to a tramping man and was a perfect fury in point of\\njealousy the murdered womanâ\\x80\\x94more a match for the man certainly in\\npoint of yearsâ\\x80\\x94was found dead in a barn near hounslow heath there had\\nbeen a violent struggle perhaps a fight she was bruised and scratched\\nand torn and had been held by the throat at last and choked now\\nthere was no reasonable evidence to implicate any person but this\\nwoman and on the improbabilities of her having been able to do it mr\\njaggers principally rested his case you may be sureâ\\x80\\x9d said wemmick\\ntouching me on the sleeve â\\x80\\x9cthat he never dwelt upon the strength of\\nher hands then though he sometimes does nowâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni had told wemmick of his showing us her wrists that day of the dinner\\nparty\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwell sirâ\\x80\\x9d wemmick went on â\\x80\\x9cit happenedâ\\x80\\x94happened donâ\\x80\\x99t you\\nseeâ\\x80\\x94that this woman was so very artfully dressed from the time of her\\napprehension that she looked much slighter than she really was in\\nparticular her sleeves are always remembered to have been so skilfully\\ncontrived that her arms had quite a delicate look she had only a\\nbruise or two about herâ\\x80\\x94nothing for a trampâ\\x80\\x94but the backs of her\\nhands were lacerated and the question was was it with fingernails\\nnow mr jaggers showed that she had struggled through a great lot of\\nbrambles which were not as high as her face but which she could not\\nhave got through and kept her hands out of and bits of those brambles\\nwere actually found in her skin and put in evidence as well as the\\nfact that the brambles in question were found on examination to have\\nbeen broken through and to have little shreds of her dress and little\\nspots of blood upon them here and there but the boldest point he made\\nwas this it was attempted to be set up in proof of her jealousy that\\nshe was under strong suspicion of having at about the time of the\\nmurder frantically destroyed her child by this manâ\\x80\\x94some three years\\noldâ\\x80\\x94to revenge herself upon him mr jaggers worked that in this way\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwe say these are not marks of fingernails but marks of brambles and\\nwe show you the brambles you say they are marks of fingernails and\\nyou set up the hypothesis that she destroyed her child you must accept\\nall consequences of that hypothesis for anything we know she may have\\ndestroyed her child and the child in clinging to her may have\\nscratched her hands what then you are not trying her for the murder\\nof her child why donâ\\x80\\x99t you as to this case if you will have\\nscratches we say that for anything we know you may have accounted\\nfor them assuming for the sake of argument that you have not invented\\nthemâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cto sum up sirâ\\x80\\x9d said wemmick â\\x80\\x9cmr jaggers was altogether too\\nmany for the jury and they gave inâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9chas she been in his service ever sinceâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyes but not only thatâ\\x80\\x9d said wemmick â\\x80\\x9cshe went into his service\\nimmediately after her acquittal tamed as she is now she has since\\nbeen taught one thing and another in the way of her duties but she was\\ntamed from the beginningâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cdo you remember the sex of the childâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9csaid to have been a girlâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou have nothing more to say to me tonightâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnothing i got your letter and destroyed it nothingâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nwe exchanged a cordial goodnight and i went home with new matter for\\nmy thoughts though with no relief from the old\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter xlix\\n\\n\\nputting miss havishamâ\\x80\\x99s note in my pocket that it might serve as my\\ncredentials for so soon reappearing at satis house in case her\\nwaywardness should lead her to express any surprise at seeing me i\\nwent down again by the coach next day but i alighted at the halfway\\nhouse and breakfasted there and walked the rest of the distance for\\ni sought to get into the town quietly by the unfrequented ways and to\\nleave it in the same manner\\n\\nthe best light of the day was gone when i passed along the quiet\\nechoing courts behind the high street the nooks of ruin where the old\\nmonks had once had their refectories and gardens and where the strong\\nwalls were now pressed into the service of humble sheds and stables\\nwere almost as silent as the old monks in their graves the cathedral\\nchimes had at once a sadder and a more remote sound to me as i hurried\\non avoiding observation than they had ever had before so the swell\\nof the old organ was borne to my ears like funeral music and the\\nrooks as they hovered about the grey tower and swung in the bare high\\ntrees of the priory garden seemed to call to me that the place was\\nchanged and that estella was gone out of it for ever\\n\\nan elderly woman whom i had seen before as one of the servants who\\nlived in the supplementary house across the back courtyard opened the\\ngate the lighted candle stood in the dark passage within as of old\\nand i took it up and ascended the staircase alone miss havisham was\\nnot in her own room but was in the larger room across the landing\\nlooking in at the door after knocking in vain i saw her sitting on\\nthe hearth in a ragged chair close before and lost in the\\ncontemplation of the ashy fire\\n\\ndoing as i had often done i went in and stood touching the old\\nchimneypiece where she could see me when she raised her eyes there\\nwas an air of utter loneliness upon her that would have moved me to\\npity though she had wilfully done me a deeper injury than i could\\ncharge her with as i stood compassionating her and thinking how in\\nthe progress of time i too had come to be a part of the wrecked\\nfortunes of that house her eyes rested on me she stared and said in\\na low voice â\\x80\\x9cis it realâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cit is i pip mr jaggers gave me your note yesterday and i have lost\\nno timeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthank you thank youâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nas i brought another of the ragged chairs to the hearth and sat down i\\nremarked a new expression on her face as if she were afraid of me\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci wantâ\\x80\\x9d she said â\\x80\\x9cto pursue that subject you mentioned to me when\\nyou were last here and to show you that i am not all stone but\\nperhaps you can never believe now that there is anything human in my\\nheartâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nwhen i said some reassuring words she stretched out her tremulous\\nright hand as though she was going to touch me but she recalled it\\nagain before i understood the action or knew how to receive it\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou said speaking for your friend that you could tell me how to do\\nsomething useful and good something that you would like done is it\\nnotâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9csomething that i would like done very muchâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhat is itâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni began explaining to her that secret history of the partnership i had\\nnot got far into it when i judged from her looks that she was thinking\\nin a discursive way of me rather than of what i said it seemed to be\\nso for when i stopped speaking many moments passed before she showed\\nthat she was conscious of the fact\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cdo you break offâ\\x80\\x9d she asked then with her former air of being afraid\\nof me â\\x80\\x9cbecause you hate me too much to bear to speak to meâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cno noâ\\x80\\x9d i answered â\\x80\\x9chow can you think so miss havisham i stopped\\nbecause i thought you were not following what i saidâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cperhaps i was notâ\\x80\\x9d she answered putting a hand to her head â\\x80\\x9cbegin\\nagain and let me look at something else stay now tell meâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nshe set her hand upon her stick in the resolute way that sometimes was\\nhabitual to her and looked at the fire with a strong expression of\\nforcing herself to attend i went on with my explanation and told her\\nhow i had hoped to complete the transaction out of my means but how in\\nthis i was disappointed that part of the subject i reminded her\\ninvolved matters which could form no part of my explanation for they\\nwere the weighty secrets of another\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9csoâ\\x80\\x9d said she assenting with her head but not looking at me â\\x80\\x9cand\\nhow much money is wanting to complete the purchaseâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni was rather afraid of stating it for it sounded a large sum â\\x80\\x9cnine\\nhundred poundsâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cif i give you the money for this purpose will you keep my secret as\\nyou have kept your ownâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cquite as faithfullyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cand your mind will be more at restâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmuch more at restâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9care you very unhappy nowâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nshe asked this question still without looking at me but in an\\nunwonted tone of sympathy i could not reply at the moment for my\\nvoice failed me she put her left arm across the head of her stick and\\nsoftly laid her forehead on it\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci am far from happy miss havisham but i have other causes of\\ndisquiet than any you know of they are the secrets i have mentionedâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nafter a little while she raised her head and looked at the fire\\nagain\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cit is noble in you to tell me that you have other causes of\\nunhappiness is it trueâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ctoo trueâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ccan i only serve you pip by serving your friend regarding that as\\ndone is there nothing i can do for you yourselfâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnothing i thank you for the question i thank you even more for the\\ntone of the question but there is nothingâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nshe presently rose from her seat and looked about the blighted room\\nfor the means of writing there were none there and she took from her\\npocket a yellow set of ivory tablets mounted in tarnished gold and\\nwrote upon them with a pencil in a case of tarnished gold that hung\\nfrom her neck\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou are still on friendly terms with mr jaggersâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cquite i dined with him yesterdayâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthis is an authority to him to pay you that money to lay out at your\\nirresponsible discretion for your friend i keep no money here but if\\nyou would rather mr jaggers knew nothing of the matter i will send it\\nto youâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthank you miss havisham i have not the least objection to receiving\\nit from himâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nshe read me what she had written and it was direct and clear and\\nevidently intended to absolve me from any suspicion of profiting by the\\nreceipt of the money i took the tablets from her hand and it trembled\\nagain and it trembled more as she took off the chain to which the\\npencil was attached and put it in mine all this she did without\\nlooking at me\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmy name is on the first leaf if you can ever write under my name â\\x80\\x9ci\\nforgive herâ\\x80\\x9d though ever so long after my broken heart is dust pray do\\nitâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9co miss havishamâ\\x80\\x9d said i â\\x80\\x9ci can do it now there have been sore\\nmistakes and my life has been a blind and thankless one and i want\\nforgiveness and direction far too much to be bitter with youâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nshe turned her face to me for the first time since she had averted it\\nand to my amazement i may even add to my terror dropped on her knees\\nat my feet with her folded hands raised to me in the manner in which\\nwhen her poor heart was young and fresh and whole they must often have\\nbeen raised to heaven from her motherâ\\x80\\x99s side\\n\\nto see her with her white hair and her worn face kneeling at my feet\\ngave me a shock through all my frame i entreated her to rise and got\\nmy arms about her to help her up but she only pressed that hand of\\nmine which was nearest to her grasp and hung her head over it and\\nwept i had never seen her shed a tear before and in the hope that\\nthe relief might do her good i bent over her without speaking she was\\nnot kneeling now but was down upon the ground\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9coâ\\x80\\x9d she cried despairingly â\\x80\\x9cwhat have i done what have i doneâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cif you mean miss havisham what have you done to injure me let me\\nanswer very little i should have loved her under any circumstances\\nis she marriedâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyesâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nit was a needless question for a new desolation in the desolate house\\nhad told me so\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhat have i done what have i doneâ\\x80\\x9d she wrung her hands and crushed\\nher white hair and returned to this cry over and over again â\\x80\\x9cwhat\\nhave i doneâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni knew not how to answer or how to comfort her that she had done a\\ngrievous thing in taking an impressionable child to mould into the form\\nthat her wild resentment spurned affection and wounded pride found\\nvengeance in i knew full well but that in shutting out the light of\\nday she had shut out infinitely more that in seclusion she had\\nsecluded herself from a thousand natural and healing influences that\\nher mind brooding solitary had grown diseased as all minds do and\\nmust and will that reverse the appointed order of their maker i knew\\nequally well and could i look upon her without compassion seeing her\\npunishment in the ruin she was in her profound unfitness for this\\nearth on which she was placed in the vanity of sorrow which had become\\na master mania like the vanity of penitence the vanity of remorse\\nthe vanity of unworthiness and other monstrous vanities that have been\\ncurses in this world\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cuntil you spoke to her the other day and until i saw in you a\\nlookingglass that showed me what i once felt myself i did not know\\nwhat i had done what have i done what have i doneâ\\x80\\x9d and so again\\ntwenty fifty times over what had she done\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmiss havishamâ\\x80\\x9d i said when her cry had died away â\\x80\\x9cyou may dismiss\\nme from your mind and conscience but estella is a different case and\\nif you can ever undo any scrap of what you have done amiss in keeping a\\npart of her right nature away from her it will be better to do that\\nthan to bemoan the past through a hundred yearsâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyes yes i know it but pipâ\\x80\\x94my dearâ\\x80\\x9d there was an earnest womanly\\ncompassion for me in her new affection â\\x80\\x9cmy dear believe this when\\nshe first came to me i meant to save her from misery like my own at\\nfirst i meant no moreâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwell wellâ\\x80\\x9d said i â\\x80\\x9ci hope soâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbut as she grew and promised to be very beautiful i gradually did\\nworse and with my praises and with my jewels and with my teachings\\nand with this figure of myself always before her a warning to back and\\npoint my lessons i stole her heart away and put ice in its placeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbetterâ\\x80\\x9d i could not help saying â\\x80\\x9cto have left her a natural heart\\neven to be bruised or brokenâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nwith that miss havisham looked distractedly at me for a while and\\nthen burst out again what had she done\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cif you knew all my storyâ\\x80\\x9d she pleaded â\\x80\\x9cyou would have some\\ncompassion for me and a better understanding of meâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmiss havishamâ\\x80\\x9d i answered as delicately as i could â\\x80\\x9ci believe i may\\nsay that i do know your story and have known it ever since i first\\nleft this neighbourhood it has inspired me with great commiseration\\nand i hope i understand it and its influences does what has passed\\nbetween us give me any excuse for asking you a question relative to\\nestella not as she is but as she was when she first came hereâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nshe was seated on the ground with her arms on the ragged chair and\\nher head leaning on them she looked full at me when i said this and\\nreplied â\\x80\\x9cgo onâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhose child was estellaâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nshe shook her head\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou donâ\\x80\\x99t knowâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nshe shook her head again\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbut mr jaggers brought her here or sent her hereâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbrought her hereâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwill you tell me how that came aboutâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nshe answered in a low whisper and with caution â\\x80\\x9ci had been shut up in\\nthese rooms a long time i donâ\\x80\\x99t know how long you know what time the\\nclocks keep here when i told him that i wanted a little girl to rear\\nand love and save from my fate i had first seen him when i sent for\\nhim to lay this place waste for me having read of him in the\\nnewspapers before i and the world parted he told me that he would\\nlook about him for such an orphan child one night he brought her here\\nasleep and i called her estellaâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmight i ask her age thenâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ctwo or three she herself knows nothing but that she was left an\\norphan and i adopted herâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nso convinced i was of that womanâ\\x80\\x99s being her mother that i wanted no\\nevidence to establish the fact in my own mind but to any mind i\\nthought the connection here was clear and straight\\n\\nwhat more could i hope to do by prolonging the interview i had\\nsucceeded on behalf of herbert miss havisham had told me all she knew\\nof estella i had said and done what i could to ease her mind no\\nmatter with what other words we parted we parted\\n\\ntwilight was closing in when i went downstairs into the natural air i\\ncalled to the woman who had opened the gate when i entered that i\\nwould not trouble her just yet but would walk round the place before\\nleaving for i had a presentiment that i should never be there again\\nand i felt that the dying light was suited to my last view of it\\n\\nby the wilderness of casks that i had walked on long ago and on which\\nthe rain of years had fallen since rotting them in many places and\\nleaving miniature swamps and pools of water upon those that stood on\\nend i made my way to the ruined garden i went all round it round by\\nthe corner where herbert and i had fought our battle round by the\\npaths where estella and i had walked so cold so lonely so dreary\\nall\\n\\ntaking the brewery on my way back i raised the rusty latch of a little\\ndoor at the garden end of it and walked through i was going out at\\nthe opposite doorâ\\x80\\x94not easy to open now for the damp wood had started\\nand swelled and the hinges were yielding and the threshold was\\nencumbered with a growth of fungusâ\\x80\\x94when i turned my head to look back\\na childish association revived with wonderful force in the moment of\\nthe slight action and i fancied that i saw miss havisham hanging to\\nthe beam so strong was the impression that i stood under the beam\\nshuddering from head to foot before i knew it was a fancyâ\\x80\\x94though to be\\nsure i was there in an instant\\n\\nthe mournfulness of the place and time and the great terror of this\\nillusion though it was but momentary caused me to feel an\\nindescribable awe as i came out between the open wooden gates where i\\nhad once wrung my hair after estella had wrung my heart passing on\\ninto the front courtyard i hesitated whether to call the woman to let\\nme out at the locked gate of which she had the key or first to go\\nupstairs and assure myself that miss havisham was as safe and well as i\\nhad left her i took the latter course and went up\\n\\ni looked into the room where i had left her and i saw her seated in\\nthe ragged chair upon the hearth close to the fire with her back\\ntowards me in the moment when i was withdrawing my head to go quietly\\naway i saw a great flaming light spring up in the same moment i saw\\nher running at me shrieking with a whirl of fire blazing all about\\nher and soaring at least as many feet above her head as she was high\\n\\ni had a doublecaped greatcoat on and over my arm another thick coat\\nthat i got them off closed with her threw her down and got them over\\nher that i dragged the great cloth from the table for the same\\npurpose and with it dragged down the heap of rottenness in the midst\\nand all the ugly things that sheltered there that we were on the\\nground struggling like desperate enemies and that the closer i covered\\nher the more wildly she shrieked and tried to free herselfâ\\x80\\x94that this\\noccurred i knew through the result but not through anything i felt or\\nthought or knew i did i knew nothing until i knew that we were on the\\nfloor by the great table and that patches of tinder yet alight were\\nfloating in the smoky air which a moment ago had been her faded\\nbridal dress\\n\\nthen i looked round and saw the disturbed beetles and spiders running\\naway over the floor and the servants coming in with breathless cries\\nat the door i still held her forcibly down with all my strength like\\na prisoner who might escape and i doubt if i even knew who she was or\\nwhy we had struggled or that she had been in flames or that the\\nflames were out until i saw the patches of tinder that had been her\\ngarments no longer alight but falling in a black shower around us\\n\\nshe was insensible and i was afraid to have her moved or even\\ntouched assistance was sent for and i held her until it came as if i\\nunreasonably fancied i think i did that if i let her go the fire\\nwould break out again and consume her when i got up on the surgeonâ\\x80\\x99s\\ncoming to her with other aid i was astonished to see that both my\\nhands were burnt for i had no knowledge of it through the sense of\\nfeeling\\n\\non examination it was pronounced that she had received serious hurts\\nbut that they of themselves were far from hopeless the danger lay\\nmainly in the nervous shock by the surgeonâ\\x80\\x99s directions her bed was\\ncarried into that room and laid upon the great table which happened to\\nbe well suited to the dressing of her injuries when i saw her again\\nan hour afterwards she lay indeed where i had seen her strike her\\nstick and had heard her say that she would lie one day\\n\\nthough every vestige of her dress was burnt as they told me she still\\nhad something of her old ghastly bridal appearance for they had\\ncovered her to the throat with white cottonwool and as she lay with a\\nwhite sheet loosely overlying that the phantom air of something that\\nhad been and was changed was still upon her\\n\\ni found on questioning the servants that estella was in paris and i\\ngot a promise from the surgeon that he would write to her by the next\\npost miss havishamâ\\x80\\x99s family i took upon myself intending to\\ncommunicate with mr matthew pocket only and leave him to do as he\\nliked about informing the rest this i did next day through herbert\\nas soon as i returned to town\\n\\nthere was a stage that evening when she spoke collectedly of what had\\nhappened though with a certain terrible vivacity towards midnight she\\nbegan to wander in her speech and after that it gradually set in that\\nshe said innumerable times in a low solemn voice â\\x80\\x9cwhat have i doneâ\\x80\\x9d\\nand then â\\x80\\x9cwhen she first came i meant to save her from misery like\\nmineâ\\x80\\x9d and then â\\x80\\x9ctake the pencil and write under my name â\\x80\\x98i forgive\\nherâ\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d she never changed the order of these three sentences but she\\nsometimes left out a word in one or other of them never putting in\\nanother word but always leaving a blank and going on to the next word\\n\\nas i could do no service there and as i had nearer home that\\npressing reason for anxiety and fear which even her wanderings could\\nnot drive out of my mind i decided in the course of the night that i\\nwould return by the early morning coach walking on a mile or so and\\nbeing taken up clear of the town at about six oâ\\x80\\x99clock of the morning\\ntherefore i leaned over her and touched her lips with mine just as\\nthey said not stopping for being touched â\\x80\\x9ctake the pencil and write\\nunder my name â\\x80\\x98i forgive herâ\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter l\\n\\n\\nmy hands had been dressed twice or thrice in the night and again in\\nthe morning my left arm was a good deal burned to the elbow and less\\nseverely as high as the shoulder it was very painful but the flames\\nhad set in that direction and i felt thankful it was no worse my\\nright hand was not so badly burnt but that i could move the fingers it\\nwas bandaged of course but much less inconveniently than my left hand\\nand arm those i carried in a sling and i could only wear my coat like\\na cloak loose over my shoulders and fastened at the neck my hair had\\nbeen caught by the fire but not my head or face\\n\\nwhen herbert had been down to hammersmith and seen his father he came\\nback to me at our chambers and devoted the day to attending on me he\\nwas the kindest of nurses and at stated times took off the bandages\\nand steeped them in the cooling liquid that was kept ready and put\\nthem on again with a patient tenderness that i was deeply grateful\\nfor\\n\\nat first as i lay quiet on the sofa i found it painfully difficult i\\nmight say impossible to get rid of the impression of the glare of the\\nflames their hurry and noise and the fierce burning smell if i dozed\\nfor a minute i was awakened by miss havishamâ\\x80\\x99s cries and by her\\nrunning at me with all that height of fire above her head this pain of\\nthe mind was much harder to strive against than any bodily pain i\\nsuffered and herbert seeing that did his utmost to hold my attention\\nengaged\\n\\nneither of us spoke of the boat but we both thought of it that was\\nmade apparent by our avoidance of the subject and by our\\nagreeingâ\\x80\\x94without agreementâ\\x80\\x94to make my recovery of the use of my hands a\\nquestion of so many hours not of so many weeks\\n\\nmy first question when i saw herbert had been of course whether all\\nwas well down the river as he replied in the affirmative with perfect\\nconfidence and cheerfulness we did not resume the subject until the\\nday was wearing away but then as herbert changed the bandages more\\nby the light of the fire than by the outer light he went back to it\\nspontaneously\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci sat with provis last night handel two good hoursâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhere was claraâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cdear little thingâ\\x80\\x9d said herbert â\\x80\\x9cshe was up and down with\\ngruffandgrim all the evening he was perpetually pegging at the floor\\nthe moment she left his sight i doubt if he can hold out long though\\nwhat with rum and pepperâ\\x80\\x94and pepper and rumâ\\x80\\x94i should think his\\npegging must be nearly overâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cand then you will be married herbertâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9chow can i take care of the dear child otherwiseâ\\x80\\x94lay your arm out upon\\nthe back of the sofa my dear boy and iâ\\x80\\x99ll sit down here and get the\\nbandage off so gradually that you shall not know when it comes i was\\nspeaking of provis do you know handel he improvesâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci said to you i thought he was softened when i last saw himâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cso you did and so he is he was very communicative last night and\\ntold me more of his life you remember his breaking off here about some\\nwoman that he had had great trouble withâ\\x80\\x94did i hurt youâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni had started but not under his touch his words had given me a start\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci had forgotten that herbert but i remember it now you speak of itâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwell he went into that part of his life and a dark wild part it is\\nshall i tell you or would it worry you just nowâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ctell me by all means every wordâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nherbert bent forward to look at me more nearly as if my reply had been\\nrather more hurried or more eager than he could quite account for\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyour head is coolâ\\x80\\x9d he said touching it\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cquiteâ\\x80\\x9d said i â\\x80\\x9ctell me what provis said my dear herbertâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cit seemsâ\\x80\\x9d said herbert â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x94thereâ\\x80\\x99s a bandage off most charmingly and\\nnow comes the cool oneâ\\x80\\x94makes you shrink at first my poor dear fellow\\ndonâ\\x80\\x99t it but it will be comfortable presentlyâ\\x80\\x94it seems that the woman\\nwas a young woman and a jealous woman and a revengeful woman\\nrevengeful handel to the last degreeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cto what last degreeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmurderâ\\x80\\x94does it strike too cold on that sensitive placeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci donâ\\x80\\x99t feel it how did she murder whom did she murderâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhy the deed may not have merited quite so terrible a nameâ\\x80\\x9d said\\nherbert â\\x80\\x9cbut she was tried for it and mr jaggers defended her and\\nthe reputation of that defence first made his name known to provis it\\nwas another and a stronger woman who was the victim and there had been\\na struggleâ\\x80\\x94in a barn who began it or how fair it was or how unfair\\nmay be doubtful but how it ended is certainly not doubtful for the\\nvictim was found throttledâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwas the woman brought in guiltyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cno she was acquittedâ\\x80\\x94my poor handel i hurt youâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cit is impossible to be gentler herbert yes what elseâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthis acquitted young woman and provis had a little child a little\\nchild of whom provis was exceedingly fond on the evening of the very\\nnight when the object of her jealousy was strangled as i tell you the\\nyoung woman presented herself before provis for one moment and swore\\nthat she would destroy the child which was in her possession and he\\nshould never see it again then she vanishedâ\\x80\\x94thereâ\\x80\\x99s the worst arm\\ncomfortably in the sling once more and now there remains but the right\\nhand which is a far easier job i can do it better by this light than\\nby a stronger for my hand is steadiest when i donâ\\x80\\x99t see the poor\\nblistered patches too distinctlyâ\\x80\\x94you donâ\\x80\\x99t think your breathing is\\naffected my dear boy you seem to breathe quicklyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cperhaps i do herbert did the woman keep her oathâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthere comes the darkest part of provisâ\\x80\\x99s life she didâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthat is he says she didâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhy of course my dear boyâ\\x80\\x9d returned herbert in a tone of surprise\\nand again bending forward to get a nearer look at me â\\x80\\x9che says it all\\ni have no other informationâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cno to be sureâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnow whetherâ\\x80\\x9d pursued herbert â\\x80\\x9che had used the childâ\\x80\\x99s mother ill\\nor whether he had used the childâ\\x80\\x99s mother well provis doesnâ\\x80\\x99t say but\\nshe had shared some four or five years of the wretched life he\\ndescribed to us at this fireside and he seems to have felt pity for\\nher and forbearance towards her therefore fearing he should be\\ncalled upon to depose about this destroyed child and so be the cause\\nof her death he hid himself much as he grieved for the child kept\\nhimself dark as he says out of the way and out of the trial and was\\nonly vaguely talked of as a certain man called abel out of whom the\\njealousy arose after the acquittal she disappeared and thus he lost\\nthe child and the childâ\\x80\\x99s motherâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci want to askâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ca moment my dear boy and i have done that evil genius compeyson\\nthe worst of scoundrels among many scoundrels knowing of his keeping\\nout of the way at that time and of his reasons for doing so of course\\nafterwards held the knowledge over his head as a means of keeping him\\npoorer and working him harder it was clear last night that this barbed\\nthe point of provisâ\\x80\\x99s animosityâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci want to knowâ\\x80\\x9d said i â\\x80\\x9cand particularly herbert whether he told\\nyou when this happenedâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cparticularly let me remember then what he said as to that his\\nexpression was â\\x80\\x98a round score oâ\\x80\\x99 year ago and aâ\\x80\\x99most directly after i\\ntook up wiâ\\x80\\x99 compeysonâ\\x80\\x99 how old were you when you came upon him in the\\nlittle churchyardâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci think in my seventh yearâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cay it had happened some three or four years then he said and you\\nbrought into his mind the little girl so tragically lost who would\\nhave been about your ageâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cherbertâ\\x80\\x9d said i after a short silence in a hurried way â\\x80\\x9ccan you\\nsee me best by the light of the window or the light of the fireâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cby the firelightâ\\x80\\x9d answered herbert coming close again\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9clook at meâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci do look at you my dear boyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ctouch meâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci do touch you my dear boyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou are not afraid that i am in any fever or that my head is much\\ndisordered by the accident of last nightâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnno my dear boyâ\\x80\\x9d said herbert after taking time to examine me\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou are rather excited but you are quite yourselfâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci know i am quite myself and the man we have in hiding down the\\nriver is estellaâ\\x80\\x99s fatherâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter li\\n\\n\\nwhat purpose i had in view when i was hot on tracing out and proving\\nestellaâ\\x80\\x99s parentage i cannot say it will presently be seen that the\\nquestion was not before me in a distinct shape until it was put before\\nme by a wiser head than my own\\n\\nbut when herbert and i had held our momentous conversation i was\\nseized with a feverish conviction that i ought to hunt the matter\\ndownâ\\x80\\x94that i ought not to let it rest but that i ought to see mr\\njaggers and come at the bare truth i really do not know whether i\\nfelt that i did this for estellaâ\\x80\\x99s sake or whether i was glad to\\ntransfer to the man in whose preservation i was so much concerned some\\nrays of the romantic interest that had so long surrounded me perhaps\\nthe latter possibility may be the nearer to the truth\\n\\nany way i could scarcely be withheld from going out to gerrard street\\nthat night herbertâ\\x80\\x99s representations that if i did i should probably\\nbe laid up and stricken useless when our fugitiveâ\\x80\\x99s safety would\\ndepend upon me alone restrained my impatience on the understanding\\nagain and again reiterated that come what would i was to go to mr\\njaggers tomorrow i at length submitted to keep quiet and to have my\\nhurts looked after and to stay at home early next morning we went out\\ntogether and at the corner of giltspur street by smithfield i left\\nherbert to go his way into the city and took my way to little britain\\n\\nthere were periodical occasions when mr jaggers and wemmick went over\\nthe office accounts and checked off the vouchers and put all things\\nstraight on these occasions wemmick took his books and papers into\\nmr jaggersâ\\x80\\x99s room and one of the upstairs clerks came down into the\\nouter office finding such clerk on wemmickâ\\x80\\x99s post that morning i knew\\nwhat was going on but i was not sorry to have mr jaggers and wemmick\\ntogether as wemmick would then hear for himself that i said nothing to\\ncompromise him\\n\\nmy appearance with my arm bandaged and my coat loose over my\\nshoulders favoured my object although i had sent mr jaggers a brief\\naccount of the accident as soon as i had arrived in town yet i had to\\ngive him all the details now and the speciality of the occasion caused\\nour talk to be less dry and hard and less strictly regulated by the\\nrules of evidence than it had been before while i described the\\ndisaster mr jaggers stood according to his wont before the fire\\nwemmick leaned back in his chair staring at me with his hands in the\\npockets of his trousers and his pen put horizontally into the post\\nthe two brutal casts always inseparable in my mind from the official\\nproceedings seemed to be congestively considering whether they didnâ\\x80\\x99t\\nsmell fire at the present moment\\n\\nmy narrative finished and their questions exhausted i then produced\\nmiss havishamâ\\x80\\x99s authority to receive the nine hundred pounds for\\nherbert mr jaggersâ\\x80\\x99s eyes retired a little deeper into his head when\\ni handed him the tablets but he presently handed them over to wemmick\\nwith instructions to draw the check for his signature while that was\\nin course of being done i looked on at wemmick as he wrote and mr\\njaggers poising and swaying himself on his wellpolished boots looked\\non at me â\\x80\\x9ci am sorry pipâ\\x80\\x9d said he as i put the check in my pocket\\nwhen he had signed it â\\x80\\x9cthat we do nothing for youâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmiss havisham was good enough to ask meâ\\x80\\x9d i returned â\\x80\\x9cwhether she\\ncould do nothing for me and i told her noâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ceverybody should know his own businessâ\\x80\\x9d said mr jaggers and i saw\\nwemmickâ\\x80\\x99s lips form the words â\\x80\\x9cportable propertyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci should not have told her no if i had been youâ\\x80\\x9d said mr jaggers\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbut every man ought to know his own business bestâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cevery manâ\\x80\\x99s businessâ\\x80\\x9d said wemmick rather reproachfully towards me\\nâ\\x80\\x9cis portable propertyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nas i thought the time was now come for pursuing the theme i had at\\nheart i said turning on mr jaggersâ\\x80\\x94\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci did ask something of miss havisham however sir i asked her to\\ngive me some information relative to her adopted daughter and she gave\\nme all she possessedâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cdid sheâ\\x80\\x9d said mr jaggers bending forward to look at his boots and\\nthen straightening himself â\\x80\\x9chah i donâ\\x80\\x99t think i should have done so\\nif i had been miss havisham but she ought to know her own business\\nbestâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci know more of the history of miss havishamâ\\x80\\x99s adopted child than miss\\nhavisham herself does sir i know her motherâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nmr jaggers looked at me inquiringly and repeated â\\x80\\x9cmotherâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci have seen her mother within these three daysâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyesâ\\x80\\x9d said mr jaggers\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cand so have you sir and you have seen her still more recentlyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyesâ\\x80\\x9d said mr jaggers\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cperhaps i know more of estellaâ\\x80\\x99s history than even you doâ\\x80\\x9d said i â\\x80\\x9ci\\nknow her father tooâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\na certain stop that mr jaggers came to in his mannerâ\\x80\\x94he was too\\nselfpossessed to change his manner but he could not help its being\\nbrought to an indefinably attentive stopâ\\x80\\x94assured me that he did not\\nknow who her father was this i had strongly suspected from provisâ\\x80\\x99s\\naccount as herbert had repeated it of his having kept himself dark\\nwhich i pieced on to the fact that he himself was not mr jaggersâ\\x80\\x99s\\nclient until some four years later and when he could have no reason\\nfor claiming his identity but i could not be sure of this\\nunconsciousness on mr jaggersâ\\x80\\x99s part before though i was quite sure\\nof it now\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cso you know the young ladyâ\\x80\\x99s father pipâ\\x80\\x9d said mr jaggers\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyesâ\\x80\\x9d i replied â\\x80\\x9cand his name is provisâ\\x80\\x94from new south walesâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\neven mr jaggers started when i said those words it was the slightest\\nstart that could escape a man the most carefully repressed and the\\nsooner checked but he did start though he made it a part of the\\naction of taking out his pockethandkerchief how wemmick received the\\nannouncement i am unable to say for i was afraid to look at him just\\nthen lest mr jaggersâ\\x80\\x99s sharpness should detect that there had been\\nsome communication unknown to him between us\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cand on what evidence pipâ\\x80\\x9d asked mr jaggers very coolly as he\\npaused with his handkerchief half way to his nose â\\x80\\x9cdoes provis make\\nthis claimâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9che does not make itâ\\x80\\x9d said i â\\x80\\x9cand has never made it and has no\\nknowledge or belief that his daughter is in existenceâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nfor once the powerful pockethandkerchief failed my reply was so\\nunexpected that mr jaggers put the handkerchief back into his pocket\\nwithout completing the usual performance folded his arms and looked\\nwith stern attention at me though with an immovable face\\n\\nthen i told him all i knew and how i knew it with the one reservation\\nthat i left him to infer that i knew from miss havisham what i in fact\\nknew from wemmick i was very careful indeed as to that nor did i look\\ntowards wemmick until i had finished all i had to tell and had been\\nfor some time silently meeting mr jaggersâ\\x80\\x99s look when i did at last\\nturn my eyes in wemmickâ\\x80\\x99s direction i found that he had unposted his\\npen and was intent upon the table before him\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9chahâ\\x80\\x9d said mr jaggers at last as he moved towards the papers on the\\ntable â\\x80\\x9cwhat item was it you were at wemmick when mr pip came inâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nbut i could not submit to be thrown off in that way and i made a\\npassionate almost an indignant appeal to him to be more frank and\\nmanly with me i reminded him of the false hopes into which i had\\nlapsed the length of time they had lasted and the discovery i had\\nmade and i hinted at the danger that weighed upon my spirits i\\nrepresented myself as being surely worthy of some little confidence\\nfrom him in return for the confidence i had just now imparted i said\\nthat i did not blame him or suspect him or mistrust him but i wanted\\nassurance of the truth from him and if he asked me why i wanted it\\nand why i thought i had any right to it i would tell him little as he\\ncared for such poor dreams that i had loved estella dearly and long\\nand that although i had lost her and must live a bereaved life\\nwhatever concerned her was still nearer and dearer to me than anything\\nelse in the world and seeing that mr jaggers stood quite still and\\nsilent and apparently quite obdurate under this appeal i turned to\\nwemmick and said â\\x80\\x9cwemmick i know you to be a man with a gentle\\nheart i have seen your pleasant home and your old father and all the\\ninnocent cheerful playful ways with which you refresh your business\\nlife and i entreat you to say a word for me to mr jaggers and to\\nrepresent to him that all circumstances considered he ought to be\\nmore open with meâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni have never seen two men look more oddly at one another than mr\\njaggers and wemmick did after this apostrophe at first a misgiving\\ncrossed me that wemmick would be instantly dismissed from his\\nemployment but it melted as i saw mr jaggers relax into something\\nlike a smile and wemmick become bolder\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhatâ\\x80\\x99s all thisâ\\x80\\x9d said mr jaggers â\\x80\\x9cyou with an old father and you\\nwith pleasant and playful waysâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwellâ\\x80\\x9d returned wemmick â\\x80\\x9cif i donâ\\x80\\x99t bring â\\x80\\x99em here what does it\\nmatterâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cpipâ\\x80\\x9d said mr jaggers laying his hand upon my arm and smiling\\nopenly â\\x80\\x9cthis man must be the most cunning impostor in all londonâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnot a bit of itâ\\x80\\x9d returned wemmick growing bolder and bolder â\\x80\\x9ci\\nthink youâ\\x80\\x99re anotherâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nagain they exchanged their former odd looks each apparently still\\ndistrustful that the other was taking him in\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou with a pleasant homeâ\\x80\\x9d said mr jaggers\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9csince it donâ\\x80\\x99t interfere with businessâ\\x80\\x9d returned wemmick â\\x80\\x9clet it be\\nso now i look at you sir i shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t wonder if you might be\\nplanning and contriving to have a pleasant home of your own one of\\nthese days when youâ\\x80\\x99re tired of all this workâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nmr jaggers nodded his head retrospectively two or three times and\\nactually drew a sigh â\\x80\\x9cpipâ\\x80\\x9d said he â\\x80\\x9cwe wonâ\\x80\\x99t talk about â\\x80\\x98poor\\ndreamsâ\\x80\\x99 you know more about such things than i having much fresher\\nexperience of that kind but now about this other matter iâ\\x80\\x99ll put a\\ncase to you mind i admit nothingâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nhe waited for me to declare that i quite understood that he expressly\\nsaid that he admitted nothing\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnow pipâ\\x80\\x9d said mr jaggers â\\x80\\x9cput this case put the case that a\\nwoman under such circumstances as you have mentioned held her child\\nconcealed and was obliged to communicate the fact to her legal\\nadviser on his representing to her that he must know with an eye to\\nthe latitude of his defence how the fact stood about that child put\\nthe case that at the same time he held a trust to find a child for an\\neccentric rich lady to adopt and bring upâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci follow you sirâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cput the case that he lived in an atmosphere of evil and that all he\\nsaw of children was their being generated in great numbers for certain\\ndestruction put the case that he often saw children solemnly tried at\\na criminal bar where they were held up to be seen put the case that\\nhe habitually knew of their being imprisoned whipped transported\\nneglected cast out qualified in all ways for the hangman and growing\\nup to be hanged put the case that pretty nigh all the children he saw\\nin his daily business life he had reason to look upon as so much spawn\\nto develop into the fish that were to come to his netâ\\x80\\x94to be\\nprosecuted defended forsworn made orphans bedevilled somehowâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci follow you sirâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cput the case pip that here was one pretty little child out of the\\nheap who could be saved whom the father believed dead and dared make\\nno stir about as to whom over the mother the legal adviser had this\\npower â\\x80\\x9ci know what you did and how you did it you came so and so\\nyou did such and such things to divert suspicion i have tracked you\\nthrough it all and i tell it you all part with the child unless it\\nshould be necessary to produce it to clear you and then it shall be\\nproduced give the child into my hands and i will do my best to bring\\nyou off if you are saved your child is saved too if you are lost\\nyour child is still savedâ\\x80\\x9d put the case that this was done and that\\nthe woman was clearedâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci understand you perfectlyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbut that i make no admissionsâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthat you make no admissionsâ\\x80\\x9d and wemmick repeated â\\x80\\x9cno admissionsâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cput the case pip that passion and the terror of death had a little\\nshaken the womanâ\\x80\\x99s intellects and that when she was set at liberty\\nshe was scared out of the ways of the world and went to him to be\\nsheltered put the case that he took her in and that he kept down the\\nold wild violent nature whenever he saw an inkling of its breaking\\nout by asserting his power over her in the old way do you comprehend\\nthe imaginary caseâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cquiteâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cput the case that the child grew up and was married for money that\\nthe mother was still living that the father was still living that the\\nmother and father unknown to one another were dwelling within so many\\nmiles furlongs yards if you like of one another that the secret was\\nstill a secret except that you had got wind of it put that last case\\nto yourself very carefullyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci doâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci ask wemmick to put it to himself very carefullyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nand wemmick said â\\x80\\x9ci doâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cfor whose sake would you reveal the secret for the fatherâ\\x80\\x99s i think\\nhe would not be much the better for the mother for the motherâ\\x80\\x99s i\\nthink if she had done such a deed she would be safer where she was for\\nthe daughterâ\\x80\\x99s i think it would hardly serve her to establish her\\nparentage for the information of her husband and to drag her back to\\ndisgrace after an escape of twenty years pretty secure to last for\\nlife but add the case that you had loved her pip and had made her\\nthe subject of those â\\x80\\x98poor dreamsâ\\x80\\x99 which have at one time or another\\nbeen in the heads of more men than you think likely then i tell you\\nthat you had betterâ\\x80\\x94and would much sooner when you had thought well of\\nitâ\\x80\\x94chop off that bandaged left hand of yours with your bandaged right\\nhand and then pass the chopper on to wemmick there to cut that off\\ntooâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni looked at wemmick whose face was very grave he gravely touched his\\nlips with his forefinger i did the same mr jaggers did the same\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnow wemmickâ\\x80\\x9d said the latter then resuming his usual manner â\\x80\\x9cwhat\\nitem was it you were at when mr pip came inâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nstanding by for a little while they were at work i observed that the\\nodd looks they had cast at one another were repeated several times\\nwith this difference now that each of them seemed suspicious not to\\nsay conscious of having shown himself in a weak and unprofessional\\nlight to the other for this reason i suppose they were now\\ninflexible with one another mr jaggers being highly dictatorial and\\nwemmick obstinately justifying himself whenever there was the smallest\\npoint in abeyance for a moment i had never seen them on such ill\\nterms for generally they got on very well indeed together\\n\\nbut they were both happily relieved by the opportune appearance of\\nmike the client with the fur cap and the habit of wiping his nose on\\nhis sleeve whom i had seen on the very first day of my appearance\\nwithin those walls this individual who either in his own person or\\nin that of some member of his family seemed to be always in trouble\\nwhich in that place meant newgate called to announce that his eldest\\ndaughter was taken up on suspicion of shoplifting as he imparted this\\nmelancholy circumstance to wemmick mr jaggers standing magisterially\\nbefore the fire and taking no share in the proceedings mikeâ\\x80\\x99s eye\\nhappened to twinkle with a tear\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhat are you aboutâ\\x80\\x9d demanded wemmick with the utmost indignation\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhat do you come snivelling here forâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci didnâ\\x80\\x99t go to do it mr wemmickâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou didâ\\x80\\x9d said wemmick â\\x80\\x9chow dare you youâ\\x80\\x99re not in a fit state to\\ncome here if you canâ\\x80\\x99t come here without spluttering like a bad pen\\nwhat do you mean by itâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ca man canâ\\x80\\x99t help his feelings mr wemmickâ\\x80\\x9d pleaded mike\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9chis whatâ\\x80\\x9d demanded wemmick quite savagely â\\x80\\x9csay that againâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnow look here my manâ\\x80\\x9d said mr jaggers advancing a step and\\npointing to the door â\\x80\\x9cget out of this office iâ\\x80\\x99ll have no feelings\\nhere get outâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cit serves you rightâ\\x80\\x9d said wemmick â\\x80\\x9cget outâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nso the unfortunate mike very humbly withdrew and mr jaggers and\\nwemmick appeared to have reestablished their good understanding and\\nwent to work again with an air of refreshment upon them as if they had\\njust had lunch\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter lii\\n\\n\\nfrom little britain i went with my check in my pocket to miss\\nskiffinsâ\\x80\\x99s brother the accountant and miss skiffinsâ\\x80\\x99s brother the\\naccountant going straight to clarrikerâ\\x80\\x99s and bringing clarriker to me\\ni had the great satisfaction of concluding that arrangement it was the\\nonly good thing i had done and the only completed thing i had done\\nsince i was first apprised of my great expectations\\n\\nclarriker informing me on that occasion that the affairs of the house\\nwere steadily progressing that he would now be able to establish a\\nsmall branchhouse in the east which was much wanted for the extension\\nof the business and that herbert in his new partnership capacity would\\ngo out and take charge of it i found that i must have prepared for a\\nseparation from my friend even though my own affairs had been more\\nsettled and now indeed i felt as if my last anchor were loosening\\nits hold and i should soon be driving with the winds and waves\\n\\nbut there was recompense in the joy with which herbert would come home\\nof a night and tell me of these changes little imagining that he told\\nme no news and would sketch airy pictures of himself conducting clara\\nbarley to the land of the arabian nights and of me going out to join\\nthem with a caravan of camels i believe and of our all going up the\\nnile and seeing wonders without being sanguine as to my own part in\\nthose bright plans i felt that herbertâ\\x80\\x99s way was clearing fast and\\nthat old bill barley had but to stick to his pepper and rum and his\\ndaughter would soon be happily provided for\\n\\nwe had now got into the month of march my left arm though it\\npresented no bad symptoms took in the natural course so long to heal\\nthat i was still unable to get a coat on my right arm was tolerably\\nrestored disfigured but fairly serviceable\\n\\non a monday morning when herbert and i were at breakfast i received\\nthe following letter from wemmick by the post\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwalworth burn this as soon as read early in the week or say\\nwednesday you might do what you know of if you felt disposed to try\\nit now burnâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nwhen i had shown this to herbert and had put it in the fireâ\\x80\\x94but not\\nbefore we had both got it by heartâ\\x80\\x94we considered what to do for of\\ncourse my being disabled could now be no longer kept out of view\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci have thought it over again and againâ\\x80\\x9d said herbert â\\x80\\x9cand i think i\\nknow a better course than taking a thames waterman take startop a\\ngood fellow a skilled hand fond of us and enthusiastic and\\nhonourableâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni had thought of him more than once\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbut how much would you tell him herbertâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cit is necessary to tell him very little let him suppose it a mere\\nfreak but a secret one until the morning comes then let him know\\nthat there is urgent reason for your getting provis aboard and away\\nyou go with himâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cno doubtâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhereâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nit had seemed to me in the many anxious considerations i had given the\\npoint almost indifferent what port we made forâ\\x80\\x94hamburg rotterdam\\nantwerpâ\\x80\\x94the place signified little so that he was out of england any\\nforeign steamer that fell in our way and would take us up would do i\\nhad always proposed to myself to get him well down the river in the\\nboat certainly well beyond gravesend which was a critical place for\\nsearch or inquiry if suspicion were afoot as foreign steamers would\\nleave london at about the time of highwater our plan would be to get\\ndown the river by a previous ebbtide and lie by in some quiet spot\\nuntil we could pull off to one the time when one would be due where we\\nlay wherever that might be could be calculated pretty nearly if we\\nmade inquiries beforehand\\n\\nherbert assented to all this and we went out immediately after\\nbreakfast to pursue our investigations we found that a steamer for\\nhamburg was likely to suit our purpose best and we directed our\\nthoughts chiefly to that vessel but we noted down what other foreign\\nsteamers would leave london with the same tide and we satisfied\\nourselves that we knew the build and colour of each we then separated\\nfor a few hours i to get at once such passports as were necessary\\nherbert to see startop at his lodgings we both did what we had to do\\nwithout any hindrance and when we met again at one oâ\\x80\\x99clock reported it\\ndone i for my part was prepared with passports herbert had seen\\nstartop and he was more than ready to join\\n\\nthose two should pull a pair of oars we settled and i would steer\\nour charge would be sitter and keep quiet as speed was not our\\nobject we should make way enough we arranged that herbert should not\\ncome home to dinner before going to mill pond bank that evening that\\nhe should not go there at all tomorrow evening tuesday that he\\nshould prepare provis to come down to some stairs hard by the house on\\nwednesday when he saw us approach and not sooner that all the\\narrangements with him should be concluded that monday night and that\\nhe should be communicated with no more in any way until we took him on\\nboard\\n\\nthese precautions well understood by both of us i went home\\n\\non opening the outer door of our chambers with my key i found a letter\\nin the box directed to me a very dirty letter though not\\nillwritten it had been delivered by hand of course since i left\\nhome and its contents were theseâ\\x80\\x94\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cif you are not afraid to come to the old marshes tonight or tomorrow\\nnight at nine and to come to the little sluicehouse by the limekiln\\nyou had better come if you want information regarding your uncle\\nprovis you had much better come and tell no one and lose no time\\nyou must come alone bring this with youâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni had had load enough upon my mind before the receipt of this strange\\nletter what to do now i could not tell and the worst was that i\\nmust decide quickly or i should miss the afternoon coach which would\\ntake me down in time for tonight tomorrow night i could not think of\\ngoing for it would be too close upon the time of the flight and\\nagain for anything i knew the proffered information might have some\\nimportant bearing on the flight itself\\n\\nif i had had ample time for consideration i believe i should still\\nhave gone having hardly any time for considerationâ\\x80\\x94my watch showing\\nme that the coach started within half an hourâ\\x80\\x94i resolved to go i\\nshould certainly not have gone but for the reference to my uncle\\nprovis that coming on wemmickâ\\x80\\x99s letter and the morningâ\\x80\\x99s busy\\npreparation turned the scale\\n\\nit is so difficult to become clearly possessed of the contents of\\nalmost any letter in a violent hurry that i had to read this\\nmysterious epistle again twice before its injunction to me to be\\nsecret got mechanically into my mind yielding to it in the same\\nmechanical kind of way i left a note in pencil for herbert telling\\nhim that as i should be so soon going away i knew not for how long i\\nhad decided to hurry down and back to ascertain for myself how miss\\nhavisham was faring i had then barely time to get my greatcoat lock\\nup the chambers and make for the coachoffice by the short byways if\\ni had taken a hackneychariot and gone by the streets i should have\\nmissed my aim going as i did i caught the coach just as it came out\\nof the yard i was the only inside passenger jolting away kneedeep in\\nstraw when i came to myself\\n\\nfor i really had not been myself since the receipt of the letter it\\nhad so bewildered me ensuing on the hurry of the morning the morning\\nhurry and flutter had been great for long and anxiously as i had\\nwaited for wemmick his hint had come like a surprise at last and now\\ni began to wonder at myself for being in the coach and to doubt\\nwhether i had sufficient reason for being there and to consider\\nwhether i should get out presently and go back and to argue against\\never heeding an anonymous communication and in short to pass through\\nall those phases of contradiction and indecision to which i suppose\\nvery few hurried people are strangers still the reference to provis\\nby name mastered everything i reasoned as i had reasoned already\\nwithout knowing itâ\\x80\\x94if that be reasoningâ\\x80\\x94in case any harm should\\nbefall him through my not going how could i ever forgive myself\\n\\nit was dark before we got down and the journey seemed long and dreary\\nto me who could see little of it inside and who could not go outside\\nin my disabled state avoiding the blue boar i put up at an inn of\\nminor reputation down the town and ordered some dinner while it was\\npreparing i went to satis house and inquired for miss havisham she\\nwas still very ill though considered something better\\n\\nmy inn had once been a part of an ancient ecclesiastical house and i\\ndined in a little octagonal commonroom like a font as i was not able\\nto cut my dinner the old landlord with a shining bald head did it for\\nme this bringing us into conversation he was so good as to entertain\\nme with my own storyâ\\x80\\x94of course with the popular feature that\\npumblechook was my earliest benefactor and the founder of my fortunes\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cdo you know the young manâ\\x80\\x9d said i\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cknow himâ\\x80\\x9d repeated the landlord â\\x80\\x9cever since he wasâ\\x80\\x94no height at\\nallâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cdoes he ever come back to this neighbourhoodâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cay he comes backâ\\x80\\x9d said the landlord â\\x80\\x9cto his great friends now and\\nagain and gives the cold shoulder to the man that made himâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhat man is thatâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9chim that i speak ofâ\\x80\\x9d said the landlord â\\x80\\x9cmr pumblechookâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cis he ungrateful to no one elseâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cno doubt he would be if he couldâ\\x80\\x9d returned the landlord â\\x80\\x9cbut he\\ncanâ\\x80\\x99t and why because pumblechook done everything for himâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cdoes pumblechook say soâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9csay soâ\\x80\\x9d replied the landlord â\\x80\\x9che hanâ\\x80\\x99t no call to say soâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbut does he say soâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cit would turn a manâ\\x80\\x99s blood to white wine winegar to hear him tell of\\nit sirâ\\x80\\x9d said the landlord\\n\\ni thought â\\x80\\x9cyet joe dear joe you never tell of it longsuffering\\nand loving joe you never complain nor you sweettempered biddyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyour appetiteâ\\x80\\x99s been touched like by your accidentâ\\x80\\x9d said the\\nlandlord glancing at the bandaged arm under my coat â\\x80\\x9ctry a tenderer\\nbitâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cno thank youâ\\x80\\x9d i replied turning from the table to brood over the\\nfire â\\x80\\x9ci can eat no more please take it awayâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni had never been struck at so keenly for my thanklessness to joe as\\nthrough the brazen impostor pumblechook the falser he the truer joe\\nthe meaner he the nobler joe\\n\\nmy heart was deeply and most deservedly humbled as i mused over the\\nfire for an hour or more the striking of the clock aroused me but not\\nfrom my dejection or remorse and i got up and had my coat fastened\\nround my neck and went out i had previously sought in my pockets for\\nthe letter that i might refer to it again but i could not find it\\nand was uneasy to think that it must have been dropped in the straw of\\nthe coach i knew very well however that the appointed place was the\\nlittle sluicehouse by the limekiln on the marshes and the hour nine\\ntowards the marshes i now went straight having no time to spare\\n\\nillustration\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter liii\\n\\n\\nit was a dark night though the full moon rose as i left the enclosed\\nlands and passed out upon the marshes beyond their dark line there\\nwas a ribbon of clear sky hardly broad enough to hold the red large\\nmoon in a few minutes she had ascended out of that clear field in\\namong the piled mountains of cloud\\n\\nthere was a melancholy wind and the marshes were very dismal a\\nstranger would have found them insupportable and even to me they were\\nso oppressive that i hesitated half inclined to go back but i knew\\nthem well and could have found my way on a far darker night and had\\nno excuse for returning being there so having come there against my\\ninclination i went on against it\\n\\nthe direction that i took was not that in which my old home lay nor\\nthat in which we had pursued the convicts my back was turned towards\\nthe distant hulks as i walked on and though i could see the old\\nlights away on the spits of sand i saw them over my shoulder i knew\\nthe limekiln as well as i knew the old battery but they were miles\\napart so that if a light had been burning at each point that night\\nthere would have been a long strip of the blank horizon between the two\\nbright specks\\n\\nat first i had to shut some gates after me and now and then to stand\\nstill while the cattle that were lying in the bankedup pathway arose\\nand blundered down among the grass and reeds but after a little while\\ni seemed to have the whole flats to myself\\n\\nit was another halfhour before i drew near to the kiln the lime was\\nburning with a sluggish stifling smell but the fires were made up and\\nleft and no workmen were visible hard by was a small stonequarry it\\nlay directly in my way and had been worked that day as i saw by the\\ntools and barrows that were lying about\\n\\ncoming up again to the marsh level out of this excavationâ\\x80\\x94for the rude\\npath lay through itâ\\x80\\x94i saw a light in the old sluicehouse i quickened\\nmy pace and knocked at the door with my hand waiting for some reply\\ni looked about me noticing how the sluice was abandoned and broken\\nand how the houseâ\\x80\\x94of wood with a tiled roofâ\\x80\\x94would not be proof against\\nthe weather much longer if it were so even now and how the mud and\\nooze were coated with lime and how the choking vapour of the kiln\\ncrept in a ghostly way towards me still there was no answer and i\\nknocked again no answer still and i tried the latch\\n\\nit rose under my hand and the door yielded looking in i saw a\\nlighted candle on a table a bench and a mattress on a truckle\\nbedstead as there was a loft above i called â\\x80\\x9cis there any one hereâ\\x80\\x9d\\nbut no voice answered then i looked at my watch and finding that it\\nwas past nine called again â\\x80\\x9cis there any one hereâ\\x80\\x9d there being still\\nno answer i went out at the door irresolute what to do\\n\\nit was beginning to rain fast seeing nothing save what i had seen\\nalready i turned back into the house and stood just within the\\nshelter of the doorway looking out into the night while i was\\nconsidering that some one must have been there lately and must soon be\\ncoming back or the candle would not be burning it came into my head\\nto look if the wick were long i turned round to do so and had taken\\nup the candle in my hand when it was extinguished by some violent\\nshock and the next thing i comprehended was that i had been caught in\\na strong running noose thrown over my head from behind\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnowâ\\x80\\x9d said a suppressed voice with an oath â\\x80\\x9ciâ\\x80\\x99ve got youâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhat is thisâ\\x80\\x9d i cried struggling â\\x80\\x9cwho is it help help helpâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nnot only were my arms pulled close to my sides but the pressure on my\\nbad arm caused me exquisite pain sometimes a strong manâ\\x80\\x99s hand\\nsometimes a strong manâ\\x80\\x99s breast was set against my mouth to deaden my\\ncries and with a hot breath always close to me i struggled\\nineffectually in the dark while i was fastened tight to the wall â\\x80\\x9cand\\nnowâ\\x80\\x9d said the suppressed voice with another oath â\\x80\\x9ccall out again and\\niâ\\x80\\x99ll make short work of youâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nfaint and sick with the pain of my injured arm bewildered by the\\nsurprise and yet conscious how easily this threat could be put in\\nexecution i desisted and tried to ease my arm were it ever so little\\nbut it was bound too tight for that i felt as if having been burnt\\nbefore it were now being boiled\\n\\nthe sudden exclusion of the night and the substitution of black\\ndarkness in its place warned me that the man had closed a shutter\\nafter groping about for a little he found the flint and steel he\\nwanted and began to strike a light i strained my sight upon the\\nsparks that fell among the tinder and upon which he breathed and\\nbreathed match in hand but i could only see his lips and the blue\\npoint of the match even those but fitfully the tinder was dampâ\\x80\\x94no\\nwonder thereâ\\x80\\x94and one after another the sparks died out\\n\\nthe man was in no hurry and struck again with the flint and steel as\\nthe sparks fell thick and bright about him i could see his hands and\\ntouches of his face and could make out that he was seated and bending\\nover the table but nothing more presently i saw his blue lips again\\nbreathing on the tinder and then a flare of light flashed up and\\nshowed me orlick\\n\\nwhom i had looked for i donâ\\x80\\x99t know i had not looked for him seeing\\nhim i felt that i was in a dangerous strait indeed and i kept my eyes\\nupon him\\n\\nhe lighted the candle from the flaring match with great deliberation\\nand dropped the match and trod it out then he put the candle away\\nfrom him on the table so that he could see me and sat with his arms\\nfolded on the table and looked at me i made out that i was fastened to\\na stout perpendicular ladder a few inches from the wallâ\\x80\\x94a fixture\\nthereâ\\x80\\x94the means of ascent to the loft above\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnowâ\\x80\\x9d said he when we had surveyed one another for some time â\\x80\\x9ciâ\\x80\\x99ve\\ngot youâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cunbind me let me goâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cahâ\\x80\\x9d he returned â\\x80\\x9ciâ\\x80\\x99ll let you go iâ\\x80\\x99ll let you go to the moon\\niâ\\x80\\x99ll let you go to the stars all in good timeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhy have you lured me hereâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cdonâ\\x80\\x99t you knowâ\\x80\\x9d said he with a deadly look\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhy have you set upon me in the darkâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbecause i mean to do it all myself one keeps a secret better than\\ntwo o you enemy you enemyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nhis enjoyment of the spectacle i furnished as he sat with his arms\\nfolded on the table shaking his head at me and hugging himself had a\\nmalignity in it that made me tremble as i watched him in silence he\\nput his hand into the corner at his side and took up a gun with a\\nbrassbound stock\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cdo you know thisâ\\x80\\x9d said he making as if he would take aim at me â\\x80\\x9cdo\\nyou know where you saw it afore speak wolfâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyesâ\\x80\\x9d i answered\\n\\nillustration\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou cost me that place you did speakâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhat else could i doâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou did that and that would be enough without more how dared you to\\ncome betwixt me and a young woman i likedâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhen did iâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhen didnâ\\x80\\x99t you it was you as always give old orlick a bad name to\\nherâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou gave it to yourself you gained it for yourself i could have done\\nyou no harm if you had done yourself noneâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyouâ\\x80\\x99re a liar and youâ\\x80\\x99ll take any pains and spend any money to\\ndrive me out of this country will youâ\\x80\\x9d said he repeating my words to\\nbiddy in the last interview i had with her â\\x80\\x9cnow iâ\\x80\\x99ll tell you a piece\\nof information it was never so well worth your while to get me out of\\nthis country as it is tonight ah if it was all your money twenty\\ntimes told to the last brass fardenâ\\x80\\x9d as he shook his heavy hand at\\nme with his mouth snarling like a tigerâ\\x80\\x99s i felt that it was true\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhat are you going to do to meâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ciâ\\x80\\x99m agoingâ\\x80\\x9d said he bringing his fist down upon the table with a\\nheavy blow and rising as the blow fell to give it greater forceâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9ciâ\\x80\\x99m\\nagoing to have your lifeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nhe leaned forward staring at me slowly unclenched his hand and drew it\\nacross his mouth as if his mouth watered for me and sat down again\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou was always in old orlickâ\\x80\\x99s way since ever you was a child you\\ngoes out of his way this present night heâ\\x80\\x99ll have no more on you\\nyouâ\\x80\\x99re deadâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni felt that i had come to the brink of my grave for a moment i looked\\nwildly round my trap for any chance of escape but there was none\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmore than thatâ\\x80\\x9d said he folding his arms on the table again â\\x80\\x9ci\\nwonâ\\x80\\x99t have a rag of you i wonâ\\x80\\x99t have a bone of you left on earth\\niâ\\x80\\x99ll put your body in the kilnâ\\x80\\x94iâ\\x80\\x99d carry two such to it on my\\nshouldersâ\\x80\\x94and let people suppose what they may of you they shall\\nnever know nothingâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nmy mind with inconceivable rapidity followed out all the consequences\\nof such a death estellaâ\\x80\\x99s father would believe i had deserted him\\nwould be taken would die accusing me even herbert would doubt me\\nwhen he compared the letter i had left for him with the fact that i had\\ncalled at miss havishamâ\\x80\\x99s gate for only a moment joe and biddy would\\nnever know how sorry i had been that night none would ever know what i\\nhad suffered how true i had meant to be what an agony i had passed\\nthrough the death close before me was terrible but far more terrible\\nthan death was the dread of being misremembered after death and so\\nquick were my thoughts that i saw myself despised by unborn\\ngenerationsâ\\x80\\x94estellaâ\\x80\\x99s children and their childrenâ\\x80\\x94while the wretchâ\\x80\\x99s\\nwords were yet on his lips\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnow wolfâ\\x80\\x9d said he â\\x80\\x9cafore i kill you like any other beastâ\\x80\\x94which is\\nwot i mean to do and wot i have tied you up forâ\\x80\\x94iâ\\x80\\x99ll have a good look\\nat you and a good goad at you o you enemyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nit had passed through my thoughts to cry out for help again though few\\ncould know better than i the solitary nature of the spot and the\\nhopelessness of aid but as he sat gloating over me i was supported by\\na scornful detestation of him that sealed my lips above all things i\\nresolved that i would not entreat him and that i would die making some\\nlast poor resistance to him softened as my thoughts of all the rest of\\nmen were in that dire extremity humbly beseeching pardon as i did of\\nheaven melted at heart as i was by the thought that i had taken no\\nfarewell and never now could take farewell of those who were dear to\\nme or could explain myself to them or ask for their compassion on my\\nmiserable errorsâ\\x80\\x94still if i could have killed him even in dying i\\nwould have done it\\n\\nhe had been drinking and his eyes were red and bloodshot around his\\nneck was slung a tin bottle as i had often seen his meat and drink\\nslung about him in other days he brought the bottle to his lips and\\ntook a fiery drink from it and i smelt the strong spirits that i saw\\nflash into his face\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwolfâ\\x80\\x9d said he folding his arms again â\\x80\\x9cold orlickâ\\x80\\x99s agoing to tell\\nyou somethink it was you as did for your shrew sisterâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nagain my mind with its former inconceivable rapidity had exhausted\\nthe whole subject of the attack upon my sister her illness and her\\ndeath before his slow and hesitating speech had formed these words\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cit was you villainâ\\x80\\x9d said i\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci tell you it was your doingâ\\x80\\x94i tell you it was done through youâ\\x80\\x9d he\\nretorted catching up the gun and making a blow with the stock at the\\nvacant air between us â\\x80\\x9ci come upon her from behind as i come upon you\\ntonight i givâ\\x80\\x99 it her i left her for dead and if there had been a\\nlimekiln as nigh her as there is now nigh you she shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t have come\\nto life again but it warnâ\\x80\\x99t old orlick as did it it was you you was\\nfavoured and he was bullied and beat old orlick bullied and beat eh\\nnow you pays for it you done it now you pays for itâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nhe drank again and became more ferocious i saw by his tilting of the\\nbottle that there was no great quantity left in it i distinctly\\nunderstood that he was working himself up with its contents to make an\\nend of me i knew that every drop it held was a drop of my life i knew\\nthat when i was changed into a part of the vapour that had crept\\ntowards me but a little while before like my own warning ghost he\\nwould do as he had done in my sisterâ\\x80\\x99s caseâ\\x80\\x94make all haste to the\\ntown and be seen slouching about there drinking at the alehouses my\\nrapid mind pursued him to the town made a picture of the street with\\nhim in it and contrasted its lights and life with the lonely marsh and\\nthe white vapour creeping over it into which i should have dissolved\\n\\nit was not only that i could have summed up years and years and years\\nwhile he said a dozen words but that what he did say presented\\npictures to me and not mere words in the excited and exalted state of\\nmy brain i could not think of a place without seeing it or of persons\\nwithout seeing them it is impossible to overstate the vividness of\\nthese images and yet i was so intent all the time upon him\\nhimselfâ\\x80\\x94who would not be intent on the tiger crouching to springâ\\x80\\x94that\\ni knew of the slightest action of his fingers\\n\\nwhen he had drunk this second time he rose from the bench on which he\\nsat and pushed the table aside then he took up the candle and\\nshading it with his murderous hand so as to throw its light on me\\nstood before me looking at me and enjoying the sight\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwolf iâ\\x80\\x99ll tell you something more it was old orlick as you tumbled\\nover

â\\x80\\x99ware\\ncompeyson magwitch and the gallowsâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nhe flared the candle at me again smoking my face and hair and for an\\ninstant blinding me and turned his powerful back as he replaced the\\nlight on the table i had thought a prayer and had been with joe and\\nbiddy and herbert before he turned towards me again\\n\\nthere was a clear space of a few feet between the table and the\\nopposite wall within this space he now slouched backwards and\\nforwards his great strength seemed to sit stronger upon him than ever\\nbefore as he did this with his hands hanging loose and heavy at his\\nsides and with his eyes scowling at me i had no grain of hope left\\nwild as my inward hurry was and wonderful the force of the pictures\\nthat rushed by me instead of thoughts i could yet clearly understand\\nthat unless he had resolved that i was within a few moments of surely\\nperishing out of all human knowledge he would never have told me what\\nhe had told\\n\\nof a sudden he stopped took the cork out of his bottle and tossed it\\naway light as it was i heard it fall like a plummet he swallowed\\nslowly tilting up the bottle by little and little and now he looked\\nat me no more the last few drops of liquor he poured into the palm of\\nhis hand and licked up then with a sudden hurry of violence and\\nswearing horribly he threw the bottle from him and stooped and i saw\\nin his hand a stonehammer with a long heavy handle\\n\\nthe resolution i had made did not desert me for without uttering one\\nvain word of appeal to him i shouted out with all my might and\\nstruggled with all my might it was only my head and my legs that i\\ncould move but to that extent i struggled with all the force until\\nthen unknown that was within me in the same instant i heard\\nresponsive shouts saw figures and a gleam of light dash in at the\\ndoor heard voices and tumult and saw orlick emerge from a struggle of\\nmen as if it were tumbling water clear the table at a leap and fly\\nout into the night\\n\\nafter a blank i found that i was lying unbound on the floor in the\\nsame place with my head on some oneâ\\x80\\x99s knee my eyes were fixed on the\\nladder against the wall when i came to myselfâ\\x80\\x94had opened on it before\\nmy mind saw itâ\\x80\\x94and thus as i recovered consciousness i knew that i\\nwas in the place where i had lost it\\n\\ntoo indifferent at first even to look round and ascertain who\\nsupported me i was lying looking at the ladder when there came\\nbetween me and it a face the face of trabbâ\\x80\\x99s boy\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci think heâ\\x80\\x99s all rightâ\\x80\\x9d said trabbâ\\x80\\x99s boy in a sober voice â\\x80\\x9cbut\\nainâ\\x80\\x99t he just pale thoughâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nat these words the face of him who supported me looked over into mine\\nand i saw my supporter to beâ\\x80\\x94\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cherbert great heavenâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9csoftlyâ\\x80\\x9d said herbert â\\x80\\x9cgently

inâ\\x80\\x9d said herbert â\\x80\\x9cand be\\ncalmâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthe allusion made me spring up though i dropped again from the pain in\\nmy arm â\\x80\\x9cthe time has not gone by herbert has it what night is\\ntonight how long have i been hereâ\\x80\\x9d for i had a strange and strong\\nmisgiving that i had been lying there a long timeâ\\x80\\x94a day and a\\nnightâ\\x80\\x94two days and nightsâ\\x80\\x94more\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthe time has not gone by it is still monday nightâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthank godâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cand you have all tomorrow tuesday to rest inâ\\x80\\x9d said herbert â\\x80\\x9cbut\\nyou canâ\\x80\\x99t help groaning my dear handel what hurt have you got can\\nyou standâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyes yesâ\\x80\\x9d said i â\\x80\\x9ci can walk i have no hurt but in this throbbing\\narmâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthey laid it bare and did what they could it was violently swollen\\nand inflamed and i could scarcely endure to have it touched but they\\ntore up their handkerchiefs to make fresh bandages and carefully\\nreplaced it in the sling until we could get to the town and obtain\\nsome cooling lotion to put upon it in a little while we had shut the\\ndoor of the dark and empty sluicehouse and were passing through the\\nquarry on our way back trabbâ\\x80\\x99s boyâ\\x80\\x94trabbâ\\x80\\x99s overgrown young man\\nnowâ\\x80\\x94went before us with a lantern which was the light i had seen come\\nin at the door but the moon was a good two hours higher than when i\\nhad last seen the sky and the night though rainy was much lighter\\nthe white vapour of the kiln was passing from us as we went by and as\\ni had thought a prayer before i thought a thanksgiving now\\n\\nentreating herbert to tell me how he had come to my rescueâ\\x80\\x94which at\\nfirst he had flatly refused to do but had insisted on my remaining\\nquietâ\\x80\\x94i learnt that i had in my hurry dropped the letter open in our\\nchambers where he coming home to bring with him startop whom he had\\nmet in the street on his way to me found it very soon after i was\\ngone its tone made him uneasy and the more so because of the\\ninconsistency between it and the hasty letter i had left for him his\\nuneasiness increasing instead of subsiding after a quarter of an\\nhourâ\\x80\\x99s consideration he set off for the coachoffice with startop who\\nvolunteered his company to make inquiry when the next coach went down\\nfinding that the afternoon coach was gone and finding that his\\nuneasiness grew into positive alarm as obstacles came in his way he\\nresolved to follow in a postchaise so he and startop arrived at the\\nblue boar fully expecting there to find me or tidings of me but\\nfinding neither went on to miss havishamâ\\x80\\x99s where they lost me\\nhereupon they went back to the hotel doubtless at about the time when\\ni was hearing the popular local version of my own story to refresh\\nthemselves and to get some one to guide them out upon the marshes\\namong the loungers under the boarâ\\x80\\x99s archway happened to be trabbâ\\x80\\x99s\\nboyâ\\x80\\x94true to his ancient habit of happening to be everywhere where he\\nhad no businessâ\\x80\\x94and trabbâ\\x80\\x99s boy had seen me passing from miss\\nhavishamâ\\x80\\x99s in the direction of my diningplace thus trabbâ\\x80\\x99s boy became\\ntheir guide and with him they went out to the sluicehouse though by\\nthe town way to the marshes which i had avoided now as they went\\nalong herbert reflected that i might after all have been brought\\nthere on some genuine and serviceable errand tending to provisâ\\x80\\x99s\\nsafety and bethinking himself that in that case interruption must be\\nmischievous left his guide and startop on the edge of the quarry and\\nwent on by himself and stole round the house two or three times\\nendeavouring to ascertain whether all was right within as he could\\nhear nothing but indistinct sounds of one deep rough voice this was\\nwhile my mind was so busy he even at last began to doubt whether i\\nwas there when suddenly i cried out loudly and he answered the cries\\nand rushed in closely followed by the other two\\n\\nwhen i told herbert what had passed within the house he was for our\\nimmediately going before a magistrate in the town late at night as it\\nwas and getting out a warrant but i had already considered that such\\na course by detaining us there or binding us to come back might be\\nfatal to provis there was no gainsaying this difficulty and we\\nrelinquished all thoughts of pursuing orlick at that time for the\\npresent under the circumstances we deemed it prudent to make rather\\nlight of the matter to trabbâ\\x80\\x99s boy who i am convinced would have\\nbeen much affected by disappointment if he had known that his\\nintervention saved me from the limekiln not that trabbâ\\x80\\x99s boy was of a\\nmalignant nature but that he had too much spare vivacity and that it\\nwas in his constitution to want variety and excitement at anybodyâ\\x80\\x99s\\nexpense when we parted i presented him with two guineas which seemed\\nto meet his views and told him that i was sorry ever to have had an\\nill opinion of him which made no impression on him at all\\n\\nwednesday being so close upon us we determined to go back to london\\nthat night three in the postchaise the rather as we should then be\\nclear away before the nightâ\\x80\\x99s adventure began to be talked of herbert\\ngot a large bottle of stuff for my arm and by dint of having this\\nstuff dropped over it all the night through i was just able to bear\\nits pain on the journey it was daylight when we reached the temple\\nand i went at once to bed and lay in bed all day\\n\\nmy terror as i lay there of falling ill and being unfitted for\\ntomorrow was so besetting that i wonder it did not disable me of\\nitself it would have done so pretty surely in conjunction with the\\nmental wear and tear i had suffered but for the unnatural strain upon\\nme that tomorrow was so anxiously looked forward to charged with\\nsuch consequences its results so impenetrably hidden though so near\\n\\nno precaution could have been more obvious than our refraining from\\ncommunication with him that day yet this again increased my\\nrestlessness i started at every footstep and every sound believing\\nthat he was discovered and taken and this was the messenger to tell me\\nso i persuaded myself that i knew he was taken that there was\\nsomething more upon my mind than a fear or a presentiment that the\\nfact had occurred and i had a mysterious knowledge of it as the days\\nwore on and no ill news came as the day closed in and darkness fell\\nmy overshadowing dread of being disabled by illness before tomorrow\\nmorning altogether mastered me my burning arm throbbed and my burning\\nhead throbbed and i fancied i was beginning to wander i counted up to\\nhigh numbers to make sure of myself and repeated passages that i knew\\nin prose and verse it happened sometimes that in the mere escape of a\\nfatigued mind i dozed for some moments or forgot then i would say to\\nmyself with a start â\\x80\\x9cnow it has come and i am turning deliriousâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthey kept me very quiet all day and kept my arm constantly dressed\\nand gave me cooling drinks whenever i fell asleep i awoke with the\\nnotion i had had in the sluicehouse that a long time had elapsed and\\nthe opportunity to save him was gone about midnight i got out of bed\\nand went to herbert with the conviction that i had been asleep for\\nfourandtwenty hours and that wednesday was past it was the last\\nselfexhausting effort of my fretfulness for after that i slept\\nsoundly\\n\\nwednesday morning was dawning when i looked out of window the winking\\nlights upon the bridges were already pale the coming sun was like a\\nmarsh of fire on the horizon the river still dark and mysterious was\\nspanned by bridges that were turning coldly grey with here and there\\nat top a warm touch from the burning in the sky as i looked along the\\nclustered roofs with churchtowers and spires shooting into the\\nunusually clear air the sun rose up and a veil seemed to be drawn\\nfrom the river and millions of sparkles burst out upon its waters\\nfrom me too a veil seemed to be drawn and i felt strong and well\\n\\nherbert lay asleep in his bed and our old fellowstudent lay asleep on\\nthe sofa i could not dress myself without help but i made up the\\nfire which was still burning and got some coffee ready for them in\\ngood time they too started up strong and well and we admitted the\\nsharp morning air at the windows and looked at the tide that was still\\nflowing towards us\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhen it turns at nine oâ\\x80\\x99clockâ\\x80\\x9d said herbert cheerfully â\\x80\\x9clook out\\nfor us and stand ready you over there at mill pond bankâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter liv\\n\\n\\nit was one of those march days when the sun shines hot and the wind\\nblows cold when it is summer in the light and winter in the shade we\\nhad our peacoats with us and i took a bag of all my worldly\\npossessions i took no more than the few necessaries that filled the\\nbag where i might go what i might do or when i might return were\\nquestions utterly unknown to me nor did i vex my mind with them for\\nit was wholly set on provisâ\\x80\\x99s safety i only wondered for the passing\\nmoment as i stopped at the door and looked back under what altered\\ncircumstances i should next see those rooms if ever\\n\\nwe loitered down to the temple stairs and stood loitering there as if\\nwe were not quite decided to go upon the water at all of course i had\\ntaken care that the boat should be ready and everything in order after\\na little show of indecision which there were none to see but the two\\nor three amphibious creatures belonging to our temple stairs we went\\non board and cast off herbert in the bow i steering it was then\\nabout highwaterâ\\x80\\x94halfpast eight\\n\\nour plan was this the tide beginning to run down at nine and being\\nwith us until three we intended still to creep on after it had turned\\nand row against it until dark we should then be well in those long\\nreaches below gravesend between kent and essex where the river is\\nbroad and solitary where the waterside inhabitants are very few and\\nwhere lone publichouses are scattered here and there of which we\\ncould choose one for a restingplace there we meant to lie by all\\nnight the steamer for hamburg and the steamer for rotterdam would\\nstart from london at about nine on thursday morning we should know at\\nwhat time to expect them according to where we were and would hail\\nthe first so that if by any accident we were not taken abroad we\\nshould have another chance we knew the distinguishing marks of each\\nvessel\\n\\nthe relief of being at last engaged in the execution of the purpose was\\nso great to me that i felt it difficult to realise the condition in\\nwhich i had been a few hours before the crisp air the sunlight the\\nmovement on the river and the moving river itselfâ\\x80\\x94the road that ran\\nwith us seeming to sympathise with us animate us and encourage us\\nonâ\\x80\\x94freshened me with new hope i felt mortified to be of so little use\\nin the boat but there were few better oarsmen than my two friends\\nand they rowed with a steady stroke that was to last all day\\n\\nat that time the steamtraffic on the thames was far below its present\\nextent and watermenâ\\x80\\x99s boats were far more numerous of barges sailing\\ncolliers and coastingtraders there were perhaps as many as now but\\nof steamships great and small not a tithe or a twentieth part so\\nmany early as it was there were plenty of scullers going here and\\nthere that morning and plenty of barges dropping down with the tide\\nthe navigation of the river between bridges in an open boat was a\\nmuch easier and commoner matter in those days than it is in these and\\nwe went ahead among many skiffs and wherries briskly\\n\\nold london bridge was soon passed and old billingsgate market with its\\noysterboats and dutchmen and the white tower and traitorâ\\x80\\x99s gate and\\nwe were in among the tiers of shipping here were the leith aberdeen\\nand glasgow steamers loading and unloading goods and looking\\nimmensely high out of the water as we passed alongside here were\\ncolliers by the score and score with the coalwhippers plunging off\\nstages on deck as counterweights to measures of coal swinging up\\nwhich were then rattled over the side into barges here at her\\nmoorings was tomorrowâ\\x80\\x99s steamer for rotterdam of which we took good\\nnotice and here tomorrowâ\\x80\\x99s for hamburg under whose bowsprit we\\ncrossed and now i sitting in the stern could see with a faster\\nbeating heart mill pond bank and mill pond stairs\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cis he thereâ\\x80\\x9d said herbert\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnot yetâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cright he was not to come down till he saw us can you see his\\nsignalâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnot well from here but i think i see itâ\\x80\\x94now i see him pull both\\neasy herbert oarsâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nwe touched the stairs lightly for a single moment and he was on board\\nand we were off again he had a boatcloak with him and a black canvas\\nbag and he looked as like a riverpilot as my heart could have wished\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cdear boyâ\\x80\\x9d he said putting his arm on my shoulder as he took his\\nseat â\\x80\\x9cfaithful dear boy well done thankye thankyeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nagain among the tiers of shipping in and out avoiding rusty\\nchaincables frayed hempen hawsers and bobbing buoys sinking for the\\nmoment floating broken baskets scattering floating chips of wood and\\nshaving cleaving floating scum of coal in and out under the\\nfigurehead of the john of sunderland making a speech to the winds\\nas is done by many johns and the betsy of yarmouth with a firm\\nformality of bosom and her knobby eyes starting two inches out of her\\nhead in and out hammers going in shipbuildersâ\\x80\\x99 yards saws going at\\ntimber clashing engines going at things unknown pumps going in leaky\\nships capstans going ships going out to sea and unintelligible\\nseacreatures roaring curses over the bulwarks at respondent\\nlightermen in and outâ\\x80\\x94out at last upon the clearer river where the\\nshipsâ\\x80\\x99 boys might take their fenders in no longer fishing in troubled\\nwaters with them over the side and where the festooned sails might fly\\nout to the wind\\n\\nat the stairs where we had taken him abroad and ever since i had\\nlooked warily for any token of our being suspected i had seen none we\\ncertainly had not been and at that time as certainly we were not\\neither attended or followed by any boat if we had been waited on by\\nany boat i should have run in to shore and have obliged her to go on\\nor to make her purpose evident but we held our own without any\\nappearance of molestation\\n\\nhe had his boatcloak on him and looked as i have said a natural\\npart of the scene it was remarkable but perhaps the wretched life he\\nhad led accounted for it that he was the least anxious of any of us\\nhe was not indifferent for he told me that he hoped to live to see his\\ngentleman one of the best of gentlemen in a foreign country he was not\\ndisposed to be passive or resigned as i understood it but he had no\\nnotion of meeting danger half way when it came upon him he confronted\\nit but it must come before he troubled himself\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cif you knowed dear boyâ\\x80\\x9d he said to me â\\x80\\x9cwhat it is to sit here\\nalonger my dear boy and have my smoke arter having been day by day\\nbetwixt four walls youâ\\x80\\x99d envy me but you donâ\\x80\\x99t know what it isâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci think i know the delights of freedomâ\\x80\\x9d i answered\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cahâ\\x80\\x9d said he shaking

lowâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nit occurred to me as inconsistent that for any mastering idea he\\nshould have endangered his freedom and even his life but i reflected\\nthat perhaps freedom without danger was too much apart from all the\\nhabit of his existence to be to him what it would be to another man i\\nwas not far out since he said after smoking a littleâ\\x80\\x94\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou see dear boy when i was over yonder tâ\\x80\\x99other side the world i\\nwas always a looking to this side and it come flat to be there for\\nall i was a growing rich everybody knowed magwitch and magwitch could\\ncome and magwitch could go and nobodyâ\\x80\\x99s head would be troubled about\\nhim they ainâ\\x80\\x99t so easy concerning me here dear boyâ\\x80\\x94wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t be\\nleastwise if they knowed where i wasâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cif all goes wellâ\\x80\\x9d said i â\\x80\\x9cyou will be perfectly free and safe again\\nwithin a few hoursâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwellâ\\x80\\x9d he returned drawing a long breath â\\x80\\x9ci hope soâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cand think soâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nhe dipped his hand in the water over the boatâ\\x80\\x99s gunwale and said\\nsmiling with that softened air upon him which was not new to meâ\\x80\\x94\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cay i sâ\\x80\\x99pose i think so dear boy weâ\\x80\\x99d be puzzled to be more quiet\\nand easygoing than we are at present butâ\\x80\\x94itâ\\x80\\x99s a flowing so soft and\\npleasant through the water pâ\\x80\\x99raps as makes me think itâ\\x80\\x94i was a\\nthinking through my smoke just then that we can no more see to the\\nbottom of the next few hours than we can see to the bottom of this\\nriver what i catches hold of nor yet we canâ\\x80\\x99t no more hold their tide\\nthan i can hold this and itâ\\x80\\x99s run through my fingers and gone you\\nseeâ\\x80\\x9d holding up his dripping hand\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbut for your face i should think you were a little despondentâ\\x80\\x9d said\\ni\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnot a bit on it dear boy it comes of flowing on so quiet and of\\nthat there rippling at the boatâ\\x80\\x99s head making a sort of a sunday tune\\nmaybe iâ\\x80\\x99m a growing a trifle old besidesâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nhe put his pipe back in his mouth with an undisturbed expression of\\nface and sat as composed and contented as if we were already out of\\nengland yet he was as submissive to a word of advice as if he had been\\nin constant terror for when we ran ashore to get some bottles of beer\\ninto the boat and he was stepping out i hinted that i thought he\\nwould be safest where he was and he said â\\x80\\x9cdo you dear boyâ\\x80\\x9d and\\nquietly sat down again\\n\\nthe air felt cold upon the river but it was a bright day and the\\nsunshine was very cheering the tide ran strong i took care to lose\\nnone of it and our steady stroke carried us on thoroughly well by\\nimperceptible degrees as the tide ran out we lost more and more of\\nthe nearer woods and hills and dropped lower and lower between the\\nmuddy banks but the tide was yet with us when we were off gravesend\\nas our charge was wrapped in his cloak i purposely passed within a\\nboat or twoâ\\x80\\x99s length of the floating custom house and so out to catch\\nthe stream alongside of two emigrant ships and under the bows of a\\nlarge transport with troops on the forecastle looking down at us and\\nsoon the tide began to slacken and the craft lying at anchor to swing\\nand presently they had all swung round and the ships that were taking\\nadvantage of the new tide to get up to the pool began to crowd upon us\\nin a fleet and we kept under the shore as much out of the strength of\\nthe tide now as we could standing carefully off from low shallows and\\nmudbanks\\n\\nour oarsmen were so fresh by dint of having occasionally let her drive\\nwith the tide for a minute or two that a quarter of an hourâ\\x80\\x99s rest\\nproved full as much as they wanted we got ashore among some slippery\\nstones while we ate and drank what we had with us and looked about it\\nwas like my own marsh country flat and monotonous and with a dim\\nhorizon while the winding river turned and turned and the great\\nfloating buoys upon it turned and turned and everything else seemed\\nstranded and still for now the last of the fleet of ships was round\\nthe last low point we had headed and the last green barge\\nstrawladen with a brown sail had followed and some\\nballastlighters shaped like a childâ\\x80\\x99s first rude imitation of a boat\\nlay low in the mud and a little squat shoallighthouse on open piles\\nstood crippled in the mud on stilts and crutches and slimy stakes\\nstuck out of the mud and slimy stones stuck out of the mud and red\\nlandmarks and tidemarks stuck out of the mud and an old landingstage\\nand an old roofless building slipped into the mud and all about us was\\nstagnation and mud\\n\\nwe pushed off again and made what way we could it was much harder\\nwork now but herbert and startop persevered and rowed and rowed and\\nrowed until the sun went down by that time the river had lifted us a\\nlittle so that we could see above the bank there was the red sun on\\nthe low level of the shore in a purple haze fast deepening into\\nblack and there was the solitary flat marsh and far away there were\\nthe rising grounds between which and us there seemed to be no life\\nsave here and there in the foreground a melancholy gull\\n\\nas the night was fast falling and as the moon being past the full\\nwould not rise early we held a little council a short one for\\nclearly our course was to lie by at the first lonely tavern we could\\nfind so they plied their oars once more and i looked out for\\nanything like a house thus we held on speaking little for four or\\nfive dull miles it was very cold and a collier coming by us with\\nher galleyfire smoking and flaring looked like a comfortable home\\nthe night was as dark by this time as it would be until morning and\\nwhat light we had seemed to come more from the river than the sky as\\nthe oars in their dipping struck at a few reflected stars\\n\\nat this dismal time we were evidently all possessed by the idea that we\\nwere followed as the tide made it flapped heavily at irregular\\nintervals against the shore and whenever such a sound came one or\\nother of us was sure to start and look in that direction here and\\nthere the set of the current had worn down the bank into a little\\ncreek and we were all suspicious of such places and eyed them\\nnervously sometimes â\\x80\\x9cwhat was that rippleâ\\x80\\x9d one of us would say in a\\nlow voice or another â\\x80\\x9cis that a boat yonderâ\\x80\\x9d and afterwards we would\\nfall into a dead silence and i would sit impatiently thinking with\\nwhat an unusual amount of noise the oars worked in the thowels\\n\\nat length we descried a light and a roof and presently afterwards ran\\nalongside a little causeway made of stones that had been picked up hard\\nby leaving the rest in the boat i stepped ashore and found the light\\nto be in a window of a publichouse it was a dirty place enough and i\\ndare say not unknown to smuggling adventurers but there was a good\\nfire in the kitchen and there were eggs and bacon to eat and various\\nliquors to drink also there were two doublebedded roomsâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9csuch as\\nthey wereâ\\x80\\x9d the landlord said no other company was in the house than\\nthe landlord his wife and a grizzled male creature the â\\x80\\x9cjackâ\\x80\\x9d of the\\nlittle causeway who was as slimy and smeary as if he had been\\nlowwater mark too\\n\\nwith this assistant i went down to the boat again and we all came\\nashore and brought out the oars and rudder and boathook and all\\nelse and hauled her up for the night we made a very good meal by the\\nkitchen fire and then apportioned the bedrooms herbert and startop\\nwere to occupy one i and our charge the other we found the air as\\ncarefully excluded from both as if air were fatal to life and there\\nwere more dirty clothes and bandboxes under the beds than i should have\\nthought the family possessed but we considered ourselves well off\\nnotwithstanding for a more solitary place we could not have found\\n\\nwhile we were comforting ourselves by the fire after our meal the\\njackâ\\x80\\x94who was sitting in a corner and who had a bloated pair of shoes\\non which he had exhibited while we were eating our eggs and bacon as\\ninteresting relics that he had taken a few days ago from the feet of a\\ndrowned seaman washed ashoreâ\\x80\\x94asked me if we had seen a fouroared\\ngalley going up with the tide when i told him no he said she must\\nhave gone down then and yet she â\\x80\\x9ctook up tooâ\\x80\\x9d when she left there\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthey must haâ\\x80\\x99 thought better onâ\\x80\\x99t for some reason or anotherâ\\x80\\x9d said\\nthe jack â\\x80\\x9cand gone downâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ca fouroared galley did you sayâ\\x80\\x9d said i\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ca fourâ\\x80\\x9d said the jack â\\x80\\x9cand two

as if much\\nmud had washed into his throat\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9che thinksâ\\x80\\x9d said the landlord a weakly meditative man with a pale\\neye who seemed to rely greatly on his jackâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9che thinks they was what\\nthey wasnâ\\x80\\x99tâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci knows what i thinksâ\\x80\\x9d observed the jack\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou thinks custom â\\x80\\x99us jackâ\\x80\\x9d said the landlord\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci doâ\\x80\\x9d said the jack\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthen youâ\\x80\\x99re wrong jackâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cam iâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nin the infinite meaning of his reply and his boundless confidence in\\nhis views the jack took one of his bloated shoes off looked into it\\nknocked a few stones out of it on the kitchen floor and put it on\\nagain he did this with the air of a jack who was so right that he\\ncould afford to do anything\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhy what do you make out that they done with their buttons then\\njackâ\\x80\\x9d asked the landlord vacillating weakly\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cdone with their buttonsâ\\x80\\x9d returned the jack â\\x80\\x9cchucked â\\x80\\x99em overboard\\nswallered â\\x80\\x99em sowed â\\x80\\x99em to come up small salad done with their\\nbuttonsâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cdonâ\\x80\\x99t be cheeky jackâ\\x80\\x9d remonstrated the landlord in a melancholy and\\npathetic way\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ca custom â\\x80\\x99us officer knows what to do with his buttonsâ\\x80\\x9d said the\\njack repeating the obnoxious word with the greatest contempt â\\x80\\x9cwhen\\nthey comes betwixt him and his own light a four and two sitters donâ\\x80\\x99t\\ngo hanging and hovering up with one tide and down with another and\\nboth with and against another without there being custom â\\x80\\x99us at the\\nbottom of itâ\\x80\\x9d saying which he went out in disdain and the landlord\\nhaving no one to reply upon found it impracticable to pursue the\\nsubject\\n\\nthis dialogue made us all uneasy and me very uneasy the dismal wind\\nwas muttering round the house the tide was flapping at the shore and\\ni had a feeling that we were caged and threatened a fouroared galley\\nhovering about in so unusual a way as to attract this notice was an\\nugly circumstance that i could not get rid of when i had induced\\nprovis to go up to bed i went outside with my two companions startop\\nby this time knew the state of the case and held another council\\nwhether we should remain at the house until near the steamerâ\\x80\\x99s time\\nwhich would be about one in the afternoon or whether we should put off\\nearly in the morning was the question we discussed on the whole we\\ndeemed it the better course to lie where we were until within an hour\\nor so of the steamerâ\\x80\\x99s time and then to get out in her track and\\ndrift easily with the tide having settled to do this we returned into\\nthe house and went to bed\\n\\ni lay down with the greater part of my clothes on and slept well for a\\nfew hours when i awoke the wind had risen and the sign of the house\\nthe ship was creaking and banging about with noises that startled\\nme rising softly for my charge lay fast asleep i looked out of the\\nwindow it commanded the causeway where we had hauled up our boat and\\nas my eyes adapted themselves to the light of the clouded moon i saw\\ntwo men looking into her they passed by under the window looking at\\nnothing else and they did not go down to the landingplace which i\\ncould discern to be empty but struck across the marsh in the direction\\nof the nore\\n\\nmy first impulse was to call up herbert and show him the two men going\\naway but reflecting before i got into his room which was at the back\\nof the house and adjoined mine that he and startop had had a harder\\nday than i and were fatigued i forbore going back to my window i\\ncould see the two men moving over the marsh in that light however i\\nsoon lost them and feeling very cold lay down to think of the\\nmatter and fell asleep again\\n\\nwe were up early as we walked to and fro all four together before\\nbreakfast i deemed it right to recount what i had seen again our\\ncharge was the least anxious of the party it was very likely that the\\nmen belonged to the custom house he said quietly and that they had no\\nthought of us i tried to persuade myself that it was soâ\\x80\\x94as indeed\\nit might easily be however i proposed that he and i should walk away\\ntogether to a distant point we could see and that the boat should take\\nus aboard there or as near there as might prove feasible at about\\nnoon this being considered a good precaution soon after breakfast he\\nand i set forth without saying anything at the tavern\\n\\nhe smoked his pipe as we went along and sometimes stopped to clap me\\non the shoulder one would have supposed that it was i who was in\\ndanger not he and that he was reassuring me we spoke very little as\\nwe approached the point i begged him to remain in a sheltered place\\nwhile i went on to reconnoitre for it was towards it that the men had\\npassed in the night he complied and i went on alone there was no\\nboat off the point nor any boat drawn up anywhere near it nor were\\nthere any signs of the men having embarked there but to be sure the\\ntide was high and there might have been some footprints under water\\n\\nwhen he looked out from his shelter in the distance and saw that i\\nwaved my hat to him to come up he rejoined me and there we waited\\nsometimes lying on the bank wrapped in our coats and sometimes moving\\nabout to warm ourselves until we saw our boat coming round we got\\naboard easily and rowed out into the track of the steamer by that\\ntime it wanted but ten minutes of one oâ\\x80\\x99clock and we began to look out\\nfor her smoke\\n\\nbut it was halfpast one before we saw her smoke and soon afterwards\\nwe saw behind it the smoke of another steamer as they were coming on\\nat full speed we got the two bags ready and took that opportunity of\\nsaying goodbye to herbert and startop we had all shaken hands\\ncordially and neither herbertâ\\x80\\x99s eyes nor mine were quite dry when i\\nsaw a fouroared galley shoot out from under the bank but a little way\\nahead of us and row out into the same track\\n\\na stretch of shore had been as yet between us and the steamerâ\\x80\\x99s smoke\\nby reason of the bend and wind of the river but now she was visible\\ncoming head on i called to herbert and startop to keep before the\\ntide that she might see us lying by for her and i adjured provis to\\nsit quite still wrapped in his cloak he answered cheerily â\\x80\\x9ctrust to\\nme dear boyâ\\x80\\x9d and sat like a statue meantime the galley which was\\nvery skilfully handled had crossed us let us come up with her and\\nfallen alongside leaving just room enough for the play of the oars\\nshe kept alongside drifting when we drifted and pulling a stroke or\\ntwo when we pulled of the two sitters one held the rudderlines and\\nlooked at us attentivelyâ\\x80\\x94as did all the rowers the other sitter was\\nwrapped up much as provis was and seemed to shrink and whisper some\\ninstruction to the steerer as he looked at us not a word was spoken in\\neither boat\\n\\nstartop could make out after a few minutes which steamer was first\\nand gave me the word â\\x80\\x9chamburgâ\\x80\\x9d in a low voice as we sat face to face\\nshe was nearing us very fast and the beating of her peddles grew\\nlouder and louder i felt as if her shadow were absolutely upon us\\nwhen the galley hailed us i answered\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou have a returned transport thereâ\\x80\\x9d said the man who held the lines\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthatâ\\x80\\x99s the man wrapped in the cloak his name is abel magwitch\\notherwise provis i apprehend that man and call upon him to surrender\\nand you to assistâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nat the same moment without giving any audible direction to his crew\\nhe ran the galley abroad of us they had pulled one sudden stroke\\nahead had got their oars in had run athwart us and were holding on\\nto our gunwale before we knew what they were doing this caused great\\nconfusion on board the steamer and i heard them calling to us and\\nheard the order given to stop the paddles and heard them stop but\\nfelt her driving down upon us irresistibly in the same moment i saw\\nthe steersman of the galley lay his hand on his prisonerâ\\x80\\x99s shoulder\\nand saw that both boats were swinging round with the force of the tide\\nand saw that all hands on board the steamer were running forward quite\\nfrantically still in the same moment i saw the prisoner start up\\nlean across his captor and pull the cloak from the neck of the\\nshrinking sitter in the galley still in the same moment i saw that\\nthe face disclosed was the face of the other convict of long ago\\nstill in the same moment i saw the face tilt backward with a white\\nterror on it that i shall never forget and heard a great cry on board\\nthe steamer and a loud splash in the water and felt the boat sink\\nfrom under me\\n\\nit was but for an instant that i seemed to struggle with a thousand\\nmillweirs and a thousand flashes of light that instant past i was\\ntaken on board the galley herbert was there and startop was there\\nbut our boat was gone and the two convicts were gone\\n\\nwhat with the cries aboard the steamer and the furious blowing off of\\nher steam and her driving on and our driving on i could not at first\\ndistinguish sky from water or shore from shore but the crew of the\\ngalley righted her with great speed and pulling certain swift strong\\nstrokes ahead lay upon their oars every man looking silently and\\neagerly at the water astern presently a dark object was seen in it\\nbearing towards us on the tide no man spoke but the steersman held up\\nhis hand and all softly backed water and kept the boat straight and\\ntrue before it as it came nearer i saw it to be magwitch swimming\\nbut not swimming freely he was taken on board and instantly manacled\\nat the wrists and ankles\\n\\nthe galley was kept steady and the silent eager lookout at the water\\nwas resumed but the rotterdam steamer now came up and apparently not\\nunderstanding what had happened came on at speed by the time she had\\nbeen hailed and stopped both steamers were drifting away from us and\\nwe were rising and falling in a troubled wake of water the lookout\\nwas kept long after all was still again and the two steamers were\\ngone but everybody knew that it was hopeless now\\n\\nat length we gave it up and pulled under the shore towards the tavern\\nwe had lately left where we were received with no little surprise\\nhere i was able to get some comforts for magwitchâ\\x80\\x94provis no\\nlongerâ\\x80\\x94who had received some very severe injury in the chest and a\\ndeep cut in the head\\n\\nhe told me that he believed himself to have gone under the keel of the\\nsteamer and to have been struck on the head in rising the injury to\\nhis chest which rendered his breathing extremely painful he thought\\nhe had received against the side of the galley he added that he did\\nnot pretend to say what he might or might not have done to compeyson\\nbut that in the moment of his laying his hand on his cloak to identify\\nhim that villain had staggered up and staggered back and they had\\nboth gone overboard together when the sudden wrenching of him\\nmagwitch out of our boat and the endeavour of his captor to keep him\\nin it had capsized us he told me in a whisper that they had gone down\\nfiercely locked in each otherâ\\x80\\x99s arms and that there had been a\\nstruggle under water and that he had disengaged himself struck out\\nand swum away\\n\\ni never had any reason to doubt the exact truth of what he thus told\\nme the officer who steered the galley gave the same account of their\\ngoing overboard\\n\\nwhen i asked this officerâ\\x80\\x99s permission to change the prisonerâ\\x80\\x99s wet\\nclothes by purchasing any spare garments i could get at the\\npublichouse he gave it readily merely observing that he must take\\ncharge of everything his prisoner had about him so the pocketbook\\nwhich had once been in my hands passed into the officerâ\\x80\\x99s he further\\ngave me leave to accompany the prisoner to london but declined to\\naccord that grace to my two friends\\n\\nthe jack at the ship was instructed where the drowned man had gone\\ndown and undertook to search for the body in the places where it was\\nlikeliest to come ashore his interest in its recovery seemed to me to\\nbe much heightened when he heard that it had stockings on probably it\\ntook about a dozen drowned men to fit him out completely and that may\\nhave been the reason why the different articles of his dress were in\\nvarious stages of decay\\n\\nwe remained at the publichouse until the tide turned and then\\nmagwitch was carried down to the galley and put on board herbert and\\nstartop were to get to london by land as soon as they could we had a\\ndoleful parting and when i took my place by magwitchâ\\x80\\x99s side i felt\\nthat that was my place henceforth while he lived\\n\\nfor now my repugnance to him had all melted away and in the hunted\\nwounded shackled creature who held my hand in his i only saw a man\\nwho had meant to be my benefactor and who had felt affectionately\\ngratefully and generously towards me with great constancy through a\\nseries of years i only saw in him a much better man than i had been to\\njoe\\n\\nhis breathing became more difficult and painful as the night drew on\\nand often he could not repress a groan i tried to rest him on the arm\\ni could use in any easy position but it was dreadful to think that i\\ncould not be sorry at heart for his being badly hurt since it was\\nunquestionably best that he should die that there were still living\\npeople enough who were able and willing to identify him i could not\\ndoubt that he would be leniently treated i could not hope he who had\\nbeen presented in the worst light at his trial who had since broken\\nprison and had been tried again who had returned from transportation\\nunder a life sentence and who had occasioned the death of the man who\\nwas the cause of his arrest\\n\\nas we returned towards the setting sun we had yesterday left behind us\\nand as the stream of our hopes seemed all running back i told him how\\ngrieved i was to think that he had come home for my sake\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cdear boyâ\\x80\\x9d he answered â\\x80\\x9ciâ\\x80\\x99m quite content to take my chance iâ\\x80\\x99ve\\nseen my boy and he can be a gentleman without meâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nno i had thought about that while we had been there side by side no\\napart from any inclinations of my own i understood wemmickâ\\x80\\x99s hint now\\ni foresaw that being convicted his possessions would be forfeited to\\nthe crown\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9clookee here dear boyâ\\x80\\x9d said he â\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s best as a gentleman should not\\nbe knowed to belong to me now only come to see me as if you come by\\nchance alonger wemmick sit where i can see you when i am swore to for\\nthe last oâ\\x80\\x99 many times and i donâ\\x80\\x99t ask no moreâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci will never stir from your sideâ\\x80\\x9d said i â\\x80\\x9cwhen i am suffered to be\\nnear you please god i will be as true to you as you have been to meâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni felt his hand tremble as it held mine and he turned his face away as\\nhe lay in the bottom of the boat and i heard that old sound in his\\nthroatâ\\x80\\x94softened now like all the rest of him it was a good thing\\nthat he had touched this point for it put into my mind what i might\\nnot otherwise have thought of until too lateâ\\x80\\x94that he need never know\\nhow his hopes of enriching me had perished\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter lv\\n\\n\\nhe was taken to the police court next day and would have been\\nimmediately committed for trial but that it was necessary to send down\\nfor an old officer of the prisonship from which he had once escaped\\nto speak to his identity nobody doubted it but compeyson who had\\nmeant to depose to it was tumbling on the tides dead and it happened\\nthat there was not at that time any prison officer in london who could\\ngive the required evidence i had gone direct to mr jaggers at his\\nprivate house on my arrival over night to retain his assistance and\\nmr jaggers on the prisonerâ\\x80\\x99s behalf would admit nothing it was the\\nsole resource for he told me that the case must be over in five\\nminutes when the witness was there and that no power on earth could\\nprevent its going against us\\n\\ni imparted to mr jaggers my design of keeping him in ignorance of the\\nfate of his wealth mr jaggers was querulous and angry with me for\\nhaving â\\x80\\x9clet it slip through my fingersâ\\x80\\x9d and said we must memorialise\\nby and by and try at all events for some of it but he did not conceal\\nfrom me that although there might be many cases in which the\\nforfeiture would not be exacted there were no circumstances in this\\ncase to make it one of them i understood that very well i was not\\nrelated to the outlaw or connected with him by any recognisable tie\\nhe had put his hand to no writing or settlement in my favour before his\\napprehension and to do so now would be idle i had no claim and i\\nfinally resolved and ever afterwards abided by the resolution that my\\nheart should never be sickened with the hopeless task of attempting to\\nestablish one\\n\\nthere appeared to be reason for supposing that the drowned informer had\\nhoped for a reward out of this forfeiture and had obtained some\\naccurate knowledge of magwitchâ\\x80\\x99s affairs when his body was found many\\nmiles from the scene of his death and so horribly disfigured that he\\nwas only recognisable by the contents of his pockets notes were still\\nlegible folded in a case he carried among these were the name of a\\nbankinghouse in new south wales where a sum of money was and the\\ndesignation of certain lands of considerable value both these heads of\\ninformation were in a list that magwitch while in prison gave to mr\\njaggers of the possessions he supposed i should inherit his\\nignorance poor fellow at last served him he never mistrusted but\\nthat my inheritance was quite safe with mr jaggersâ\\x80\\x99s aid\\n\\nafter three daysâ\\x80\\x99 delay during which the crown prosecution stood over\\nfor the production of the witness from the prisonship the witness\\ncame and completed the easy case he was committed to take his trial\\nat the next sessions which would come on in a month\\n\\nit was at this dark time of my life that herbert returned home one\\nevening a good deal cast down and saidâ\\x80\\x94\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmy dear handel i fear i shall soon have to leave youâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nhis partner having prepared me for that i was less surprised than he\\nthought\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwe shall lose a fine opportunity if i put off going to cairo and i

which he was brought was so appalling to\\nboth of us that we could not refer to it in plainer words\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmy dear fellowâ\\x80\\x9d said herbert â\\x80\\x9clet the near prospect of our\\nseparationâ\\x80\\x94for it is very nearâ\\x80\\x94be my justification for troubling you\\nabout yourself have you thought of your futureâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cno for i have been afraid to think of any futureâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbut yours cannot be dismissed indeed my dear dear handel it must\\nnot be dismissed i wish you would enter on it now as far as a few\\nfriendly words go with meâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci willâ\\x80\\x9d said i\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cin this branch house of ours handel we must have aâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni saw that his delicacy was avoiding the right word so i said â\\x80\\x9ca\\nclerkâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ca clerk and i hope it is not at all unlikely that he may expand as a\\nclerk of your acquaintance has expanded into a partner now\\nhandelâ\\x80\\x94in short my dear boy will you come to meâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthere was something charmingly cordial and engaging in the manner in\\nwhich after saying â\\x80\\x9cnow handelâ\\x80\\x9d as if it were the grave beginning of\\na portentous business exordium he had suddenly given up that tone\\nstretched out his honest hand and spoken like a schoolboy\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cclara and i have talked about it again and againâ\\x80\\x9d herbert pursued\\nâ\\x80\\x9cand the dear little thing begged me only this evening with tears in\\nher eyes to say to you that if you will live with us when we come\\ntogether she will do her best to make you happy and to convince her\\nhusbandâ\\x80\\x99s friend that he is her friend too we should get on so well\\nhandelâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni thanked her heartily and i thanked him heartily but said i could\\nnot yet make sure of joining him as he so kindly offered firstly my\\nmind was too preoccupied to be able to take in the subject clearly\\nsecondlyâ\\x80\\x94yes secondly there was a vague something lingering in my\\nthoughts that will come out very near the end of this slight narrative\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbut if you thought herbert that you could without doing any injury\\nto your business leave the question open for a little whileâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cfor any whileâ\\x80\\x9d cried herbert â\\x80\\x9csix months a yearâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnot so long as thatâ\\x80\\x9d said i â\\x80\\x9ctwo or three months at mostâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nherbert was highly delighted when we shook hands on this arrangement\\nand said he could now take courage to tell me that he believed he must\\ngo away at the end of the week\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cand claraâ\\x80\\x9d said i\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthe dear little thingâ\\x80\\x9d returned herbert â\\x80\\x9cholds dutifully to her\\nfather as long as he lasts but he wonâ\\x80\\x99t last long mrs whimple\\nconfides to me that he is certainly goingâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnot to say an unfeeling thingâ\\x80\\x9d said i â\\x80\\x9che cannot do better than goâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci am afraid that must be admittedâ\\x80\\x9d said herbert â\\x80\\x9cand then i shall\\ncome back for the dear little thing and the dear little thing and i\\nwill walk quietly into the nearest church remember the blessed\\ndarling comes of no family my dear handel and never looked into the\\nred book and hasnâ\\x80\\x99t a notion about her grandpapa what a fortune for\\nthe son of my motherâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\non the saturday in that same week i took my leave of herbertâ\\x80\\x94full of\\nbright hope but sad and sorry to leave meâ\\x80\\x94as he sat on one of the\\nseaport mail coaches i went into a coffeehouse to write a little note\\nto clara telling her he had gone off sending his love to her over and\\nover again and then went to my lonely homeâ\\x80\\x94if it deserved the name\\nfor it was now no home to me and i had no home anywhere\\n\\non the stairs i encountered wemmick who was coming down after an\\nunsuccessful application of his knuckles to my door i had not seen him\\nalone since the disastrous issue of the attempted flight and he had\\ncome in his private and personal capacity to say a few words of\\nexplanation in reference to that failure\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthe late compeysonâ\\x80\\x9d said wemmick â\\x80\\x9chad by little and little got at\\nthe bottom of half of the regular business now transacted and it was\\nfrom the talk of some of his people in trouble some of his people\\nbeing always in trouble that i heard what i did i kept my ears open\\nseeming to have them shut until i heard that he was absent and i\\nthought that would be the best time for making the attempt i can only\\nsuppose now that it was a part of his policy as a very clever man\\nhabitually to deceive his own instruments you donâ\\x80\\x99t blame me i hope\\nmr pip i am sure i tried to serve you with all my heartâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci am as sure of that wemmick as you can be and i thank you most\\nearnestly for all your interest and friendshipâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthank you thank you very much itâ\\x80\\x99s a bad jobâ\\x80\\x9d said wemmick\\nscratching his head â\\x80\\x9cand i assure you i havenâ\\x80\\x99t been so cut up for a\\nlong time what i look at is the sacrifice of so much portable\\nproperty dear meâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhat i think of wemmick is the poor owner of the propertyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyes to be sureâ\\x80\\x9d said wemmick â\\x80\\x9cof course there can be no objection\\nto your being sorry for him and iâ\\x80\\x99d put down a fivepound note myself\\nto get him out of it but what i look at is this the late compeyson\\nhaving been beforehand with him in intelligence of his return and\\nbeing so determined to bring him to book i do not think he could have\\nbeen saved whereas the portable property certainly could have been\\nsaved thatâ\\x80\\x99s the difference between the property and the owner donâ\\x80\\x99t\\nyou seeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni invited wemmick to come upstairs and refresh himself with a glass of\\ngrog before walking to walworth he accepted the invitation while he\\nwas drinking his moderate allowance he said with nothing to lead up\\nto it and after having appeared rather fidgetyâ\\x80\\x94\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhat do you think of my meaning to take a holiday on monday mr pipâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhy i suppose you have not done such a thing these twelve monthsâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthese twelve years more likelyâ\\x80\\x9d said wemmick â\\x80\\x9cyes iâ\\x80\\x99m going to\\ntake a holiday more than that iâ\\x80\\x99m going to take a walk more than\\nthat iâ\\x80\\x99m going to ask you to take a walk with meâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni was about to excuse myself as being but a bad companion just then\\nwhen wemmick anticipated me\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci know your engagementsâ\\x80\\x9d said he â\\x80\\x9cand i know you are out of sorts\\nmr pip but if you could oblige me i should take it as a kindness\\nit ainâ\\x80\\x99t a long walk and itâ\\x80\\x99s an early one say it might occupy you\\nincluding breakfast on the walk from eight to twelve couldnâ\\x80\\x99t you\\nstretch a point and manage itâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nhe had done so much for me at various times that this was very little\\nto do for him i said i could manage itâ\\x80\\x94would manage itâ\\x80\\x94and he was so\\nvery much pleased by my acquiescence that i was pleased too at his\\nparticular request i appointed to call for him at the castle at half\\npast eight on monday morning and so we parted for the time\\n\\npunctual to my appointment i rang at the castle gate on the monday\\nmorning and was received by wemmick himself who struck me as looking\\ntighter than usual and having a sleeker hat on within there were two\\nglasses of rum and milk prepared and two biscuits the aged must have\\nbeen stirring with the lark for glancing into the perspective of his\\nbedroom i observed that his bed was empty\\n\\nwhen we had fortified ourselves with the rum and milk and biscuits and\\nwere going out for the walk with that training preparation on us i was\\nconsiderably surprised to see wemmick take up a fishingrod and put it\\nover his shoulder â\\x80\\x9cwhy we are not going fishingâ\\x80\\x9d said i â\\x80\\x9cnoâ\\x80\\x9d\\nreturned wemmick â\\x80\\x9cbut i like to walk with oneâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni thought this odd however i said nothing and we set off we went\\ntowards camberwell green and when we were thereabouts wemmick said\\nsuddenlyâ\\x80\\x94\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9challoa hereâ\\x80\\x99s a churchâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthere was nothing very surprising in that but again i was rather\\nsurprised when he said as if he were animated by a brilliant ideaâ\\x80\\x94\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cletâ\\x80\\x99s go inâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nwe went in wemmick leaving his fishingrod in the porch and looked\\nall round in the mean time wemmick was diving into his coatpockets\\nand getting something out of paper there\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9challoaâ\\x80\\x9d said he â\\x80\\x9chereâ\\x80\\x99s a couple of pair of gloves letâ\\x80\\x99s put â\\x80\\x99em\\nonâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nas the gloves were white kid gloves and as the postoffice was widened\\nto its utmost extent i now began to have my strong suspicions they\\nwere strengthened into certainty when i beheld the aged enter at a side\\ndoor escorting a lady\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9challoaâ\\x80\\x9d said wemmick â\\x80\\x9chereâ\\x80\\x99s miss skiffins letâ\\x80\\x99s have a weddingâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthat discreet damsel was attired as usual except that she was now\\nengaged in substituting for her green kid gloves a pair of white the\\naged was likewise occupied in preparing a similar sacrifice for the\\naltar of hymen the old gentleman however experienced so much\\ndifficulty in getting his gloves on that wemmick found it necessary to\\nput him with his back against a pillar and then to get behind the\\npillar himself and pull away at them while i for my part held the old\\ngentleman round the waist that he might present an equal and safe\\nresistance by dint of this ingenious scheme his gloves were got on to\\nperfection\\n\\nthe clerk and clergyman then appearing we were ranged in order at\\nthose fatal rails true to his notion of seeming to do it all without\\npreparation i heard wemmick say to himself as he took something out\\nof his waistcoatpocket before the service began â\\x80\\x9challoa hereâ\\x80\\x99s a\\nringâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni acted in the capacity of backer or bestman to the bridegroom\\nwhile a little limp pewopener in a soft bonnet like a babyâ\\x80\\x99s made a\\nfeint of being the bosom friend of miss skiffins the responsibility of\\ngiving the lady away devolved upon the aged which led to the\\nclergymanâ\\x80\\x99s being unintentionally scandalised and it happened thus\\nwhen he said â\\x80\\x9cwho giveth this woman to be married to this manâ\\x80\\x9d the\\nold gentleman not in the least knowing what point of the ceremony we\\nhad arrived at stood most amiably beaming at the ten commandments\\nupon which the clergyman said again â\\x80\\x9cwho giveth this woman to be\\nmarried to this manâ\\x80\\x9d the old gentleman being still in a state of most\\nestimable unconsciousness the bridegroom cried out in his accustomed\\nvoice â\\x80\\x9cnow aged p you know who givethâ\\x80\\x9d to which the aged replied\\nwith great briskness before saying that he gave â\\x80\\x9call right john\\nall right my boyâ\\x80\\x9d and the clergyman came to so gloomy a pause upon\\nit that i had doubts for the moment whether we should get completely\\nmarried that day\\n\\nit was completely done however and when we were going out of church\\nwemmick took the cover off the font and put his white gloves in it\\nand put the cover on again mrs wemmick more heedful of the future\\nput her white gloves in her pocket and assumed her green â\\x80\\x9cnow mr\\npipâ\\x80\\x9d said wemmick triumphantly shouldering the fishingrod as we came\\nout â\\x80\\x9clet me ask you whether anybody would suppose this to be a\\nweddingpartyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nbreakfast had been ordered at a pleasant little tavern a mile or so\\naway upon the rising ground beyond the green and there was a bagatelle\\nboard in the room in case we should desire to unbend our minds after\\nthe solemnity it was pleasant to observe that mrs wemmick no longer\\nunwound wemmickâ\\x80\\x99s arm when it adapted itself to her figure but sat in\\na highbacked chair against the wall like a violoncello in its case\\nand submitted to be embraced as that melodious instrument might have\\ndone\\n\\nwe had an excellent breakfast and when any one declined anything on\\ntable wemmick said â\\x80\\x9cprovided by contract you know donâ\\x80\\x99t be afraid\\nof itâ\\x80\\x9d i drank to the new couple drank to the aged drank to the\\ncastle saluted the bride at parting and made myself as agreeable as i\\ncould\\n\\nwemmick came down to the door with me and i again shook hands with\\nhim and wished him joy\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthankeeâ\\x80\\x9d said wemmick rubbing his hands â\\x80\\x9csheâ\\x80\\x99s such a manager of\\nfowls you have no idea you shall have some eggs and judge for\\nyourself i say mr pipâ\\x80\\x9d calling me back and speaking low â\\x80\\x9cthis is\\naltogether a walworth sentiment pleaseâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci understand not to be mentioned in little britainâ\\x80\\x9d said i\\n\\nwemmick nodded â\\x80\\x9cafter what you let out the other day mr jaggers may\\nas well not know of it he might think my brain was softening or\\nsomething of the kindâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter lvi\\n\\n\\nhe lay in prison very ill during the whole interval between his\\ncommittal for trial and the coming round of the sessions he had broken\\ntwo ribs they had wounded one of his lungs and he breathed with great\\npain and difficulty which increased daily it was a consequence of his\\nhurt that he spoke so low as to be scarcely audible therefore he spoke\\nvery little but he was ever ready to listen to me and it became the\\nfirst duty of my life to say to him and read to him what i knew he\\nought to hear\\n\\nbeing far too ill to remain in the common prison he was removed after\\nthe first day or so into the infirmary this gave me opportunities of\\nbeing with him that i could not otherwise have had and but for his\\nillness he would have been put in irons for he was regarded as a\\ndetermined prisonbreaker and i know not what else\\n\\nalthough i saw him every day it was for only a short time hence the\\nregularly recurring spaces of our separation were long enough to record\\non his face any slight changes that occurred in his physical state i\\ndo not recollect that i once saw any change in it for the better he\\nwasted and became slowly weaker and worse day by day from the day\\nwhen the prison door closed upon him\\n\\nthe kind of submission or resignation that he showed was that of a man\\nwho was tired out i sometimes derived an impression from his manner\\nor from a whispered word or two which escaped him that he pondered\\nover the question whether he might have been a better man under better\\ncircumstances but he never justified himself by a hint tending that\\nway or tried to bend the past out of its eternal shape\\n\\nit happened on two or three occasions in my presence that his\\ndesperate reputation was alluded to by one or other of the people in\\nattendance on him a smile crossed his face then and he turned his\\neyes on me with a trustful look as if he were confident that i had\\nseen some small redeeming touch in him even so long ago as when i was\\na little child as to all the rest he was humble and contrite and i\\nnever knew him complain\\n\\nwhen the sessions came round mr jaggers caused an application to be\\nmade for the postponement of his trial until the following sessions it\\nwas obviously made with the assurance that he could not live so long\\nand was refused the trial came on at once and when he was put to the\\nbar he was seated in a chair no objection was made to my getting\\nclose to the dock on the outside of it and holding the hand that he\\nstretched forth to me\\n\\nthe trial was very short and very clear such things as could be said\\nfor him were saidâ\\x80\\x94how he had taken to industrious habits and had\\nthriven lawfully and reputably but nothing could unsay the fact that\\nhe had returned and was there in presence of the judge and jury it\\nwas impossible to try him for that and do otherwise than find him\\nguilty\\n\\nat that time it was the custom as i learnt from my terrible\\nexperience of that sessions to devote a concluding day to the passing\\nof sentences and to make a finishing effect with the sentence of\\ndeath but for the indelible picture that my remembrance now holds\\nbefore me i could scarcely believe even as i write these words that\\ni saw twoandthirty men and women put before the judge to receive that\\nsentence together foremost among the twoandthirty was he seated\\nthat he might get breath enough to keep life in him\\n\\nthe whole scene starts out again in the vivid colours of the moment\\ndown to the drops of april rain on the windows of the court glittering\\nin the rays of april sun penned in the dock as i again stood outside\\nit at the corner with his hand in mine were the twoandthirty men and\\nwomen some defiant some stricken with terror some sobbing and\\nweeping some covering their faces some staring gloomily about there\\nhad been shrieks from among the women convicts but they had been\\nstilled and a hush had succeeded the sheriffs with their great chains\\nand nosegays other civic gewgaws and monsters criers ushers a great\\ngallery full of peopleâ\\x80\\x94a large theatrical audienceâ\\x80\\x94looked on as the\\ntwoandthirty and the judge were solemnly confronted then the judge\\naddressed them among the wretched creatures before him whom he must\\nsingle out for special address was one who almost from his infancy had\\nbeen an offender against the laws who after repeated imprisonments\\nand punishments had been at length sentenced to exile for a term of\\nyears and who under circumstances of great violence and daring had\\nmade his escape and been resentenced to exile for life that miserable\\nman would seem for a time to have become convinced of his errors when\\nfar removed from the scenes of his old offences and to have lived a\\npeaceable and honest life but in a fatal moment yielding to those\\npropensities and passions the indulgence of which had so long rendered\\nhim a scourge to society he had quitted his haven of rest and\\nrepentance and had come back to the country where he was proscribed\\nbeing here presently denounced he had for a time succeeded in evading\\nthe officers of justice but being at length seized while in the act of\\nflight he had resisted them and hadâ\\x80\\x94he best knew whether by express\\ndesign or in the blindness of his hardihoodâ\\x80\\x94caused the death of his\\ndenouncer to whom his whole career was known the appointed punishment\\nfor his return to the land that had cast him out being death and his\\ncase being this aggravated case he must prepare himself to die\\n\\nthe sun was striking in at the great windows of the court through the\\nglittering drops of rain upon the glass and it made a broad shaft of\\nlight between the twoandthirty and the judge linking both together\\nand perhaps reminding some among the audience how both were passing on\\nwith absolute equality to the greater judgment that knoweth all\\nthings and cannot err rising for a moment a distinct speck of face\\nin this way of light the prisoner said â\\x80\\x9cmy lord i have received my\\nsentence of death from the almighty but i bow to yoursâ\\x80\\x9d and sat down\\nagain there was some hushing and the judge went on with what he had\\nto say to the rest then they were all formally doomed and some of\\nthem were supported out and some of them sauntered out with a haggard\\nlook of bravery and a few nodded to the gallery and two or three\\nshook hands and others went out chewing the fragments of herb they had\\ntaken from the sweet herbs lying about he went last of all because of\\nhaving to be helped from his chair and to go very slowly and he held\\nmy hand while all the others were removed and while the audience got\\nup putting their dresses right as they might at church or elsewhere\\nand pointed down at this criminal or at that and most of all at him\\nand me\\n\\ni earnestly hoped and prayed that he might die before the recorderâ\\x80\\x99s\\nreport was made but in the dread of his lingering on i began that\\nnight to write out a petition to the home secretary of state setting\\nforth my knowledge of him and how it was that he had come back for my\\nsake i wrote it as fervently and pathetically as i could and when i\\nhad finished it and sent it in i wrote out other petitions to such men\\nin authority as i hoped were the most merciful and drew up one to the\\ncrown itself for several days and nights after he was sentenced i took\\nno rest except when i fell asleep in my chair but was wholly absorbed\\nin these appeals and after i had sent them in i could not keep away\\nfrom the places where they were but felt as if they were more hopeful\\nand less desperate when i was near them in this unreasonable\\nrestlessness and pain of mind i would roam the streets of an evening\\nwandering by those offices and houses where i had left the petitions\\nto the present hour the weary western streets of london on a cold\\ndusty spring night with their ranges of stern shutup mansions and\\ntheir long rows of lamps are melancholy to me from this association\\n\\nthe daily visits i could make him were shortened now and he was more\\nstrictly kept seeing or fancying that i was suspected of an\\nintention of carrying poison to him i asked to be searched before i\\nsat down at his bedside and told the officer who was always there\\nthat i was willing to do anything that would assure him of the\\nsingleness of my designs nobody was hard with him or with me there\\nwas duty to be done and it was done but not harshly the officer\\nalways gave me the assurance that he was worse and some other sick\\nprisoners in the room and some other prisoners who attended on them as\\nsick nurses malefactors but not incapable of kindness god be\\nthanked always joined in the same report\\n\\nas the days went on i noticed more and more that he would lie placidly\\nlooking at the white ceiling with an absence of light in his face\\nuntil some word of mine brightened it for an instant and then it would\\nsubside again sometimes he was almost or quite unable to speak then\\nhe would answer me with slight pressures on my hand and i grew to\\nunderstand his meaning very well\\n\\nthe number of the days had risen to ten when i saw a greater change in\\nhim than i had seen yet his eyes were turned towards the door and\\nlighted up as i entered\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cdear boyâ\\x80\\x9d he said as i sat down by his bed â\\x80\\x9ci thought you was late\\nbut i knowed you couldnâ\\x80\\x99t be thatâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cit is just the timeâ\\x80\\x9d said i â\\x80\\x9ci waited for it at the gateâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou always waits at the gate donâ\\x80\\x99t you dear boyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyes not to lose a moment of the timeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthankâ\\x80\\x99ee dear boy thankâ\\x80\\x99ee god bless you youâ\\x80\\x99ve never deserted me\\ndear boyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni pressed his hand in silence for i could not forget that i had once\\nmeant to desert him\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cand whatâ\\x80\\x99s the best of allâ\\x80\\x9d he said â\\x80\\x9cyouâ\\x80\\x99ve been more comfortable\\nalonger me since i was under a dark cloud than when the sun shone\\nthatâ\\x80\\x99s best of allâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nhe lay on his back breathing with great difficulty do what he would\\nand love me though he did the light left his face ever and again and\\na film came over the placid look at the white ceiling\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9care you in much pain todayâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci donâ\\x80\\x99t complain of none dear boyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou never do complainâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nhe had spoken his last words he smiled and i understood his touch to\\nmean that he wished to lift my hand and lay it on his breast i laid\\nit there and he smiled again and put both his hands upon it\\n\\nthe allotted time ran out while we were thus but looking round i\\nfound the governor of the prison standing near me and he whispered\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou neednâ\\x80\\x99t go yetâ\\x80\\x9d i thanked him gratefully and asked â\\x80\\x9cmight i\\nspeak to him if he can hear meâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthe governor stepped aside and beckoned the officer away the change\\nthough it was made without noise drew back the film from the placid\\nlook at the white ceiling and he looked most affectionately at me\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cdear magwitch i must tell you now at last you understand what i\\nsayâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\na gentle pressure on my hand\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou had a child once whom you loved and lostâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\na stronger pressure on my hand\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cshe lived and found powerful friends she is living now she is a\\nlady and very beautiful and i love herâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nwith a last faint effort which would have been powerless but for my\\nyielding to it and assisting it he raised my hand to his lips then\\nhe gently let it sink upon his breast again with his own hands lying\\non it the placid look at the white ceiling came back and passed away\\nand his head dropped quietly on his breast\\n\\nmindful then of what we had read together i thought of the two men\\nwho went up into the temple to pray and i knew there were no better\\nwords that i could say beside his bed than â\\x80\\x9co lord be merciful to him\\na sinnerâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter lvii\\n\\n\\nnow that i was left wholly to myself i gave notice of my intention to\\nquit the chambers in the temple as soon as my tenancy could legally\\ndetermine and in the meanwhile to underlet them at once i put bills\\nup in the windows for i was in debt and had scarcely any money and\\nbegan to be seriously alarmed by the state of my affairs i ought\\nrather to write that i should have been alarmed if i had had energy and\\nconcentration enough to help me to the clear perception of any truth\\nbeyond the fact that i was falling very ill the late stress upon me\\nhad enabled me to put off illness but not to put it away i knew that\\nit was coming on me now and i knew very little else and was even\\ncareless as to that\\n\\nfor a day or two i lay on the sofa or on the floorâ\\x80\\x94anywhere\\naccording as i happened to sink downâ\\x80\\x94with a heavy head and aching\\nlimbs and no purpose and no power then there came one night which\\nappeared of great duration and which teemed with anxiety and horror\\nand when in the morning i tried to sit up in my bed and think of it i\\nfound i could not do so\\n\\nwhether i really had been down in garden court in the dead of the\\nnight groping about for the boat that i supposed to be there whether\\ni had two or three times come to myself on the staircase with great\\nterror not knowing how i had got out of bed whether i had found\\nmyself lighting the lamp possessed by the idea that he was coming up\\nthe stairs and that the lights were blown out whether i had been\\ninexpressibly harassed by the distracted talking laughing and\\ngroaning of some one and had half suspected those sounds to be of my\\nown making whether there had been a closed iron furnace in a dark\\ncorner of the room and a voice had called out over and over again\\nthat miss havisham was consuming within itâ\\x80\\x94these were things that i\\ntried to settle with myself and get into some order as i lay that\\nmorning on my bed but the vapour of a limekiln would come between me\\nand them disordering them all and it was through the vapour at last\\nthat i saw two men looking at me\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhat do you wantâ\\x80\\x9d i asked starting â\\x80\\x9ci donâ\\x80\\x99t know youâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwell sirâ\\x80\\x9d returned one of them bending down and touching me on the\\nshoulder â\\x80\\x9cthis is a matter that youâ\\x80\\x99ll soon arrange i dare say but\\nyouâ\\x80\\x99re arrestedâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhat is the debtâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9chundred and twentythree pound fifteen six jewellerâ\\x80\\x99s account i\\nthinkâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhat is to be doneâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou had better come to my houseâ\\x80\\x9d said the man â\\x80\\x9ci keep a very nice\\nhouseâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni made some attempt to get up and dress myself when i next attended to\\nthem they were standing a little off from the bed looking at me i\\nstill lay there\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou see my stateâ\\x80\\x9d said i â\\x80\\x9ci would come with you if i could but\\nindeed i am quite unable if you take me from here i think i shall die\\nby the wayâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nperhaps they replied or argued the point or tried to encourage me to\\nbelieve that i was better than i thought forasmuch as they hang in my\\nmemory by only this one slender thread i donâ\\x80\\x99t know what they did\\nexcept that they forbore to remove me\\n\\nthat i had a fever and was avoided that i suffered greatly that i\\noften lost my reason that the time seemed interminable that i\\nconfounded impossible existences with my own identity that i was a\\nbrick in the housewall and yet entreating to be released from the\\ngiddy place where the builders had set me that i was a steel beam of a\\nvast engine clashing and whirling over a gulf and yet that i implored\\nin my own person to have the engine stopped and my part in it hammered\\noff that i passed through these phases of disease i know of my own\\nremembrance and did in some sort know at the time that i sometimes\\nstruggled with real people in the belief that they were murderers and\\nthat i would all at once comprehend that they meant to do me good and\\nwould then sink exhausted in their arms and suffer them to lay me\\ndown i also knew at the time but above all i knew that there was a\\nconstant tendency in all these peopleâ\\x80\\x94who when i was very ill would\\npresent all kinds of extraordinary transformations of the human face\\nand would be much dilated in sizeâ\\x80\\x94above all i say i knew that there\\nwas an extraordinary tendency in all these people sooner or later to\\nsettle down into the likeness of joe\\n\\nafter i had turned the worst point of my illness i began to notice\\nthat while all its other features changed this one consistent feature\\ndid not change whoever came about me still settled down into joe i\\nopened my eyes in the night and i saw in the great chair at the\\nbedside joe i opened my eyes in the day and sitting on the\\nwindowseat smoking his pipe in the shaded open window still i saw\\njoe i asked for cooling drink and the dear hand that gave it me was\\njoeâ\\x80\\x99s i sank back on my pillow after drinking and the face that\\nlooked so hopefully and tenderly upon me was the face of joe\\n\\nat last one day i took courage and said â\\x80\\x9cis it joeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nand the dear old homevoice answered â\\x80\\x9cwhich it air old chapâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9co joe you break my heart look angry at me joe strike me joe tell\\nme of my ingratitude donâ\\x80\\x99t be so good to meâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nfor joe had actually laid his head down on the pillow at my side and\\nput his arm round my neck in his joy that i knew him\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhich dear old pip old chapâ\\x80\\x9d said joe â\\x80\\x9cyou and me was ever friends\\nand when youâ\\x80\\x99re well enough to go out for a rideâ\\x80\\x94what larksâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nafter which joe withdrew to the window and stood with his back\\ntowards me wiping his eyes and as my extreme weakness prevented me\\nfrom getting up and going to him i lay there penitently whispering\\nâ\\x80\\x9co god bless him o god bless this gentle christian manâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\njoeâ\\x80\\x99s eyes were red when i next found him beside me but i was holding\\nhis hand and we both felt happy\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9chow long dear joeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhich you meantersay pip how long have your illness lasted dear old\\nchapâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyes joeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s the end of may pip tomorrow is the first of juneâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cand have you been here all that time dear joeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cpretty nigh old chap for as i says to biddy when the news of your\\nbeing ill were brought by letter which it were brought by the post\\nand being formerly single he is now married though underpaid for a deal\\nof walking and shoeleather but wealth were not a object on his part\\nand marriage were the great wish of his hartâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cit is so delightful to hear you joe but i interrupt you in what you\\nsaid to biddyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhich it wereâ\\x80\\x9d said joe â\\x80\\x9cthat how you might be amongst strangers\\nand that how you and me having been ever friends a wisit at such a\\nmoment might not prove unacceptabobble and biddy her word were â\\x80\\x98go\\nto him without loss of timeâ\\x80\\x99 thatâ\\x80\\x9d said joe summing up with his\\njudicial air â\\x80\\x9cwere the word of biddy â\\x80\\x98go to himâ\\x80\\x99 biddy say â\\x80\\x98without\\nloss of timeâ\\x80\\x99 in short i shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t greatly deceive youâ\\x80\\x9d joe added\\nafter a little grave reflection â\\x80\\x9cif i represented to you that the word\\nof that young woman were â\\x80\\x98without a minuteâ\\x80\\x99s loss of timeâ\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthere joe cut himself short and informed me that i was to be talked to\\nin great moderation and that i was to take a little nourishment at\\nstated frequent times whether i felt inclined for it or not and that\\ni was to submit myself to all his orders so i kissed his hand and lay\\nquiet while he proceeded to indite a note to biddy with my love in\\nit\\n\\nevidently biddy had taught joe to write as i lay in bed looking at\\nhim it made me in my weak state cry again with pleasure to see the\\npride with which he set about his letter my bedstead divested of its\\ncurtains had been removed with me upon it into the sittingroom as\\nthe airiest and largest and the carpet had been taken away and the\\nroom kept always fresh and wholesome night and day at my own\\nwritingtable pushed into a corner and cumbered with little bottles\\njoe now sat down to his great work first choosing a pen from the\\npentray as if it were a chest of large tools and tucking up his\\nsleeves as if he were going to wield a crowbar or sledgehammer it was\\nnecessary for joe to hold on heavily to the table with his left elbow\\nand to get his right leg well out behind him before he could begin\\nand when he did begin he made every downstroke so slowly that it might\\nhave been six feet long while at every upstroke i could hear his pen\\nspluttering extensively he had a curious idea that the inkstand was on\\nthe side of him where it was not and constantly dipped his pen into\\nspace and seemed quite satisfied with the result occasionally he was\\ntripped up by some orthographical stumblingblock but on the whole he\\ngot on very well indeed and when he had signed his name and had\\nremoved a finishing blot from the paper to the crown of his head with\\nhis two forefingers he got up and hovered about the table trying the\\neffect of his performance from various points of view as it lay there\\nwith unbounded satisfaction\\n\\nnot to make joe uneasy by talking too much even if i had been able to\\ntalk much i deferred asking him about miss havisham until next day he\\nshook his head when i then asked him if she had recovered\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cis she dead joeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhy you see old chapâ\\x80\\x9d said joe in a tone of remonstrance and by\\nway of getting at it by degrees â\\x80\\x9ci wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t go so far as to say that\\nfor thatâ\\x80\\x99s a deal to say but she ainâ\\x80\\x99tâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cliving joeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthatâ\\x80\\x99s nigher where it isâ\\x80\\x9d said joe â\\x80\\x9cshe ainâ\\x80\\x99t livingâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cdid she linger long joeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9carter you was took ill pretty much about what you might call if you\\nwas put to it a weekâ\\x80\\x9d said joe still determined on my account to\\ncome at everything by degrees\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cdear joe have you heard what becomes of her propertyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwell old chapâ\\x80\\x9d said joe â\\x80\\x9cit do appear that she had settled the most\\nof it which i meantersay tied it up on miss estella but she had\\nwrote out a little coddleshell in her own hand a day or two afore the\\naccident leaving a cool four thousand to mr matthew pocket and why\\ndo you suppose above all things pip she left that cool four thousand\\nunto him â\\x80\\x98because of pipâ\\x80\\x99s account of him the said matthewâ\\x80\\x99 i am\\ntold by biddy that air the writingâ\\x80\\x9d said joe repeating the legal\\nturn as if it did him infinite good â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98account of him the said\\nmatthewâ\\x80\\x99 and a cool four thousand pipâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni never discovered from whom joe derived the conventional temperature\\nof the four thousand pounds but it appeared to make the sum of money\\nmore to him and he had a manifest relish in insisting on its being\\ncool\\n\\nthis account gave me great joy as it perfected the only good thing i\\nhad done i asked joe whether he had heard if any of the other\\nrelations had any legacies\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmiss sarahâ\\x80\\x9d said joe â\\x80\\x9cshe have twentyfive pound perannium fur to\\nbuy pills on account of being bilious miss georgiana she have twenty\\npound down mrsâ\\x80\\x94whatâ\\x80\\x99s the name of them wild beasts with humps old\\nchapâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ccamelsâ\\x80\\x9d said i wondering why he could possibly want to know\\n\\njoe nodded â\\x80\\x9cmrs camelsâ\\x80\\x9d by which i presently understood he meant\\ncamilla â\\x80\\x9cshe have five pound fur to buy rushlights to put her in\\nspirits when she wake up in the nightâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthe accuracy of these recitals was sufficiently obvious to me to give\\nme great confidence in joeâ\\x80\\x99s information â\\x80\\x9cand nowâ\\x80\\x9d said joe â\\x80\\x9cyou\\nainâ\\x80\\x99t that strong yet old chap that you can take in more nor one\\nadditional shovelful today old orlick heâ\\x80\\x99s been a bustinâ\\x80\\x99 open a\\ndwellingouseâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhoseâ\\x80\\x9d said i\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnot i grant you but what his manners is given to blusterousâ\\x80\\x9d said\\njoe apologetically â\\x80\\x9cstill a englishmanâ\\x80\\x99s ouse is his castle and\\ncastles must not be busted â\\x80\\x99cept when done in war time and wotsumeâ\\x80\\x99er\\nthe failings on his part he were a corn and seedsman in his hartâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cis it pumblechookâ\\x80\\x99s house that has been broken into thenâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthatâ\\x80\\x99s it pipâ\\x80\\x9d said joe â\\x80\\x9cand they took his till and they took his\\ncashbox and they drinked his wine and they partook of his wittles\\nand they slapped his face and they pulled his nose and they tied him\\nup to his bedpust and they givâ\\x80\\x99 him a dozen and they stuffed his\\nmouth full of flowering annuals to prewent his crying out but he\\nknowed orlick and orlickâ\\x80\\x99s in the county jailâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nby these approaches we arrived at unrestricted conversation i was slow\\nto gain strength but i did slowly and surely become less weak and joe\\nstayed with me and i fancied i was little pip again\\n\\nfor the tenderness of joe was so beautifully proportioned to my need\\nthat i was like a child in his hands he would sit and talk to me in\\nthe old confidence and with the old simplicity and in the old\\nunassertive protecting way so that i would half believe that all my\\nlife since the days of the old kitchen was one of the mental troubles\\nof the fever that was gone he did everything for me except the\\nhousehold work for which he had engaged a very decent woman after\\npaying off the laundress on his first arrival â\\x80\\x9cwhich i do assure you\\npipâ\\x80\\x9d he would often say in explanation of that liberty â\\x80\\x9ci found her\\na tapping the spare bed like a cask of beer and drawing off the\\nfeathers in a bucket for sale which she would have tapped yourn next\\nand drawâ\\x80\\x99d it off with you a laying on it and was then a carrying away\\nthe coals gradiwally in the souptureen and wegetabledishes and the\\nwine and spirits in your wellington bootsâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nwe looked forward to the day when i should go out for a ride as we had\\nonce looked forward to the day of my apprenticeship and when the day\\ncame and an open carriage was got into the lane joe wrapped me up\\ntook me in his arms carried me down to it and put me in as if i were\\nstill the small helpless creature to whom he had so abundantly given of\\nthe wealth of his great nature\\n\\nand joe got in beside me and we drove away together into the country\\nwhere the rich summer growth was already on the trees and on the grass\\nand sweet summer scents filled all the air the day happened to be\\nsunday and when i looked on the loveliness around me and thought how\\nit had grown and changed and how the little wildflowers had been\\nforming and the voices of the birds had been strengthening by day and\\nby night under the sun and under the stars while poor i lay burning\\nand tossing on my bed the mere remembrance of having burned and tossed\\nthere came like a check upon my peace but when i heard the sunday\\nbells and looked around a little more upon the outspread beauty i\\nfelt that i was not nearly thankful enoughâ\\x80\\x94that i was too weak yet to\\nbe even thatâ\\x80\\x94and i laid my head on joeâ\\x80\\x99s shoulder as i had laid it\\nlong ago when he had taken me to the fair or where not and it was too\\nmuch for my young senses\\n\\nmore composure came to me after a while and we talked as we used to\\ntalk lying on the grass at the old battery there was no change\\nwhatever in joe exactly what he had been in my eyes then he was in my\\neyes still just as simply faithful and as simply right\\n\\nwhen we got back again and he lifted me out and carried meâ\\x80\\x94so\\neasilyâ\\x80\\x94across the court and up the stairs i thought of that eventful\\nchristmas day when he had carried me over the marshes we had not yet\\nmade any allusion to my change of fortune nor did i know how much of\\nmy late history he was acquainted with i was so doubtful of myself\\nnow and put so much trust in him that i could not satisfy myself\\nwhether i ought to refer to it when he did not\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9chave you heard joeâ\\x80\\x9d i asked him that evening upon further\\nconsideration as he smoked his pipe at the window â\\x80\\x9cwho my patron\\nwasâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci heerdâ\\x80\\x9d returned joe â\\x80\\x9cas it were not miss havisham old chapâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cdid you hear who it was joeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwell i heerd as it were a person what sent the person what givâ\\x80\\x99 you\\nthe banknotes at the jolly bargemen pipâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cso it wasâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9castonishingâ\\x80\\x9d said joe in the placidest way\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cdid you hear that he was dead joeâ\\x80\\x9d i presently asked with\\nincreasing diffidence\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhich him as sent the banknotes pipâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyesâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci thinkâ\\x80\\x9d said joe after meditating a long time and looking rather\\nevasively at the windowseat â\\x80\\x9cas i did hear tell that how he were\\nsomething or another in a general way in that directionâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cdid you hear anything of his circumstances joeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnot partickler pipâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cif you would like to hear joeâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d i was beginning when joe got up and\\ncame to my sofa\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9clookee here old chapâ\\x80\\x9d said joe bending over me â\\x80\\x9cever the best of\\nfriends ainâ\\x80\\x99t us pipâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni was ashamed to answer him\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwery good thenâ\\x80\\x9d said joe as if i had answered â\\x80\\x9cthatâ\\x80\\x99s all right\\nthatâ\\x80\\x99s agreed upon then why go into subjects old chap which as\\nbetwixt two sech must be for ever onnecessary thereâ\\x80\\x99s subjects enough\\nas betwixt two sech without onnecessary ones lord to think of your\\npoor sister and her rampages and donâ\\x80\\x99t you remember ticklerâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci do indeed joeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9clookee here old chapâ\\x80\\x9d said joe â\\x80\\x9ci done what i could to keep you and\\ntickler in sunders but my power were not always fully equal to my\\ninclinations for when your poor sister had a mind to drop into you it\\nwere not so muchâ\\x80\\x9d said joe in his favourite argumentative way â\\x80\\x9cthat\\nshe dropped into me too if i put myself in opposition to her but that\\nshe dropped into you always heavier for it i noticed that it ainâ\\x80\\x99t a\\ngrab at a manâ\\x80\\x99s whisker not yet a shake or two of a man to which your\\nsister was quite welcome that â\\x80\\x99ud put a man off from getting a little\\nchild out of punishment but when that little child is dropped into\\nheavier for that grab of whisker or shaking then that man naterally up\\nand says to himself â\\x80\\x98where is the good as you are adoing i grant you\\ni see the â\\x80\\x99armâ\\x80\\x99 says the man â\\x80\\x98but i donâ\\x80\\x99t see the good i call upon\\nyou sir therefore to pint out the goodâ\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthe man saysâ\\x80\\x9d i observed as joe waited for me to speak\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthe man saysâ\\x80\\x9d joe assented â\\x80\\x9cis he right that manâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cdear joe he is always rightâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwell old chapâ\\x80\\x9d said joe â\\x80\\x9cthen abide by your words if heâ\\x80\\x99s always\\nright which in general heâ\\x80\\x99s more likely wrong heâ\\x80\\x99s right when he\\nsays this supposing ever you kep any little matter to yourself when\\nyou was a little child you kep it mostly because you knowâ\\x80\\x99d as j\\ngargeryâ\\x80\\x99s power to part you and tickler in sunders were not fully equal\\nto his inclinations theerfore think no more of it as betwixt two\\nsech and do not let us pass remarks upon onnecessary subjects biddy\\ngivâ\\x80\\x99 herself a deal oâ\\x80\\x99 trouble with me afore i left for i am almost\\nawful dull as i should view it in this light and viewing it in this\\nlight as i should so put it both of whichâ\\x80\\x9d said joe quite charmed\\nwith his logical arrangement â\\x80\\x9cbeing done now this to you a true\\nfriend say namely you mustnâ\\x80\\x99t go a overdoing on it but you must\\nhave your supper and your wine and water and you must be put betwixt\\nthe sheetsâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthe delicacy with which joe dismissed this theme and the sweet tact\\nand kindness with which biddyâ\\x80\\x94who with her womanâ\\x80\\x99s wit had found me out\\nso soonâ\\x80\\x94had prepared him for it made a deep impression on my mind but\\nwhether joe knew how poor i was and how my great expectations had all\\ndissolved like our own marsh mists before the sun i could not\\nunderstand\\n\\nanother thing in joe that i could not understand when it first began to\\ndevelop itself but which i soon arrived at a sorrowful comprehension\\nof was this as i became stronger and better joe became a little less\\neasy with me in my weakness and entire dependence on him the dear\\nfellow had fallen into the old tone and called me by the old names\\nthe dear â\\x80\\x9cold pip old chapâ\\x80\\x9d that now were music in my ears i too had\\nfallen into the old ways only happy and thankful that he let me but\\nimperceptibly though i held by them fast joeâ\\x80\\x99s hold upon them began\\nto slacken and whereas i wondered at this at first i soon began to\\nunderstand that the cause of it was in me and that the fault of it was\\nall mine\\n\\nah had i given joe no reason to doubt my constancy and to think that\\nin prosperity i should grow cold to him and cast him off had i given\\njoeâ\\x80\\x99s innocent heart no cause to feel instinctively that as i got\\nstronger his hold upon me would be weaker and that he had better\\nloosen it in time and let me go before i plucked myself away\\n\\nit was on the third or fourth occasion of my going out walking in the\\ntemple gardens leaning on joeâ\\x80\\x99s arm that i saw this change in him very\\nplainly we had been sitting in the bright warm sunlight looking at\\nthe river and i chanced to say as we got upâ\\x80\\x94\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9csee joe i can walk quite strongly now you shall see me walk back\\nby myselfâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhich do not overdo it pipâ\\x80\\x9d said joe â\\x80\\x9cbut i shall be happy fur to\\nsee you able sirâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthe last word grated on me but how could i remonstrate i walked no\\nfurther than the gate of the gardens and then pretended to be weaker\\nthan i was and asked joe for his arm joe gave it me but was\\nthoughtful\\n\\ni for my part was thoughtful too for how best to check this growing\\nchange in joe was a great perplexity to my remorseful thoughts that i\\nwas ashamed to tell him exactly how i was placed and what i had come\\ndown to i do not seek to conceal but i hope my reluctance was not\\nquite an unworthy one he would want to help me out of his little\\nsavings i knew and i knew that he ought not to help me and that i\\nmust not suffer him to do it\\n\\nit was a thoughtful evening with both of us but before we went to\\nbed i had resolved that i would wait over tomorrowâ\\x80\\x94tomorrow being\\nsundayâ\\x80\\x94and would begin my new course with the new week on monday\\nmorning i would speak to joe about this change i would lay aside this\\nlast vestige of reserve i would tell him what i had in my thoughts\\nthat secondly not yet arrived at and why i had not decided to go\\nout to herbert and then the change would be conquered for ever as i\\ncleared joe cleared and it seemed as though he had sympathetically\\narrived at a resolution too\\n\\nwe had a quiet day on the sunday and we rode out into the country and\\nthen walked in the fields\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci feel thankful that i have been ill joeâ\\x80\\x9d i said\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cdear old pip old chap youâ\\x80\\x99re aâ\\x80\\x99most come round sirâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cit has been a memorable time for me joeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9clikeways for myself sirâ\\x80\\x9d joe returned\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwe have had a time together joe that i can never forget there were\\ndays once i know that i did for a while forget but i never shall\\nforget theseâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cpipâ\\x80\\x9d said joe appearing a little hurried and troubled â\\x80\\x9cthere has\\nbeen larks and dear sir what have been betwixt usâ\\x80\\x94have beenâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nat night when i had gone to bed joe came into my room as he had done\\nall through my recovery he asked me if i felt sure that i was as well\\nas in the morning\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyes dear joe quiteâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cand are always a getting stronger old chapâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyes dear joe steadilyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\njoe patted the coverlet on my shoulder with his great good hand and\\nsaid in what i thought a husky voice â\\x80\\x9cgood nightâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nwhen i got up in the morning refreshed and stronger yet i was full of\\nmy resolution to tell joe all without delay i would tell him before\\nbreakfast i would dress at once and go to his room and surprise him\\nfor it was the first day i had been up early i went to his room and\\nhe was not there not only was he not there but his box was gone\\n\\ni hurried then to the breakfasttable and on it found a letter these\\nwere its brief contentsâ\\x80\\x94\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnot wishful to intrude i have departured fur you are well again dear\\npip and will do better without\\n\\n\\njo\\n\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cps ever the best of friendsâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\nenclosed in the letter was a receipt for the debt and costs on which i\\nhad been arrested down to that moment i had vainly supposed that my\\ncreditor had withdrawn or suspended proceedings until i should be\\nquite recovered i had never dreamed of joeâ\\x80\\x99s having paid the money\\nbut joe had paid it and the receipt was in his name\\n\\nwhat remained for me now but to follow him to the dear old forge and\\nthere to have out my disclosure to him and my penitent remonstrance\\nwith him and there to relieve my mind and heart of that reserved\\nsecondly which had begun as a vague something lingering in my\\nthoughts and had formed into a settled purpose\\n\\nthe purpose was that i would go to biddy that i would show her how\\nhumbled and repentant i came back that i would tell her how i had lost\\nall i once hoped for that i would remind her of our old confidences in\\nmy first unhappy time then i would say to her â\\x80\\x9cbiddy i think you\\nonce liked me very well when my errant heart even while it strayed\\naway from you was quieter and better with you than it ever has been\\nsince if you can like me only half as well once more if you can take\\nme with all my faults and disappointments on my head if you can\\nreceive me like a forgiven child and indeed i am as sorry biddy and\\nhave as much need of a hushing voice and a soothing hand i hope i am\\na little worthier of you that i wasâ\\x80\\x94not much but a little and\\nbiddy it shall rest with you to say whether i shall work at the forge\\nwith joe or whether i shall try for any different occupation down in\\nthis country or whether we shall go away to a distant place where an\\nopportunity awaits me which i set aside when it was offered until i\\nknew your answer and now dear biddy if you can tell me that you will\\ngo through the world with me you will surely make it a better world\\nfor me and me a better man for it and i will try hard to make it a\\nbetter world for youâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nsuch was my purpose after three days more of recovery i went down to\\nthe old place to put it in execution and how i sped in it is all i\\nhave left to tell\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter lviii\\n\\n\\nthe tidings of my high fortunes having had a heavy fall had got down to\\nmy native place and its neighbourhood before i got there i found the\\nblue boar in possession of the intelligence and i found that it made a\\ngreat change in the boarâ\\x80\\x99s demeanour whereas the boar had cultivated\\nmy good opinion with warm assiduity when i was coming into property\\nthe boar was exceedingly cool on the subject now that i was going out\\nof property\\n\\nit was evening when i arrived much fatigued by the journey i had so\\noften made so easily the boar could not put me into my usual bedroom\\nwhich was engaged probably by some one who had expectations and\\ncould only assign me a very indifferent chamber among the pigeons and\\npostchaises up the yard but i had as sound a sleep in that lodging as\\nin the most superior accommodation the boar could have given me and\\nthe quality of my dreams was about the same as in the best bedroom\\n\\nearly in the morning while my breakfast was getting ready i strolled\\nround by satis house there were printed bills on the gate and on bits\\nof carpet hanging out of the windows announcing a sale by auction of\\nthe household furniture and effects next week the house itself was to\\nbe sold as old building materials and pulled down lot 1 was marked in\\nwhitewashed knockknee letters on the brew house lot 2 on that part of\\nthe main building which had been so long shut up other lots were\\nmarked off on other parts of the structure and the ivy had been torn\\ndown to make room for the inscriptions and much of it trailed low in\\nthe dust and was withered already stepping in for a moment at the open\\ngate and looking around me with the uncomfortable air of a stranger\\nwho had no business there i saw the auctioneerâ\\x80\\x99s clerk walking on the\\ncasks and telling them off for the information of a cataloguecompiler\\npen in hand who made a temporary desk of the wheeled chair i had so\\noften pushed along to the tune of old clem\\n\\nwhen i got back to my breakfast in the boarâ\\x80\\x99s coffeeroom i found mr\\npumblechook conversing with the landlord mr pumblechook not improved\\nin appearance by his late nocturnal adventure was waiting for me and\\naddressed me in the following termsâ\\x80\\x94\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyoung man i am sorry to see you brought low but what else could be\\nexpected what else could be expectedâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nas he extended his hand with a magnificently forgiving air and as i\\nwas broken by illness and unfit to quarrel i took it\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwilliamâ\\x80\\x9d said mr pumblechook to the waiter â\\x80\\x9cput a muffin on table\\nand has it come to this has it come to thisâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni frowningly sat down to my breakfast mr pumblechook stood over me\\nand poured out my teaâ\\x80\\x94before i could touch the teapotâ\\x80\\x94with the air of a\\nbenefactor who was resolved to be true to the last\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwilliamâ\\x80\\x9d said mr pumblechook mournfully â\\x80\\x9cput the salt on in\\nhappier timesâ\\x80\\x9d addressing me â\\x80\\x9ci think you took sugar and did you\\ntake milk you did sugar and milk william bring a watercressâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthank youâ\\x80\\x9d said i shortly â\\x80\\x9cbut i donâ\\x80\\x99t eat watercressesâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou donâ\\x80\\x99t eat â\\x80\\x99emâ\\x80\\x9d returned mr pumblechook sighing and nodding his\\nhead several times as if he might have expected that and as if\\nabstinence from watercresses were consistent with my downfall â\\x80\\x9ctrue\\nthe simple fruits of the earth no you neednâ\\x80\\x99t bring any williamâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni went on with my breakfast and mr pumblechook continued to stand\\nover me staring fishily and breathing noisily as he always did\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9clittle more than skin and boneâ\\x80\\x9d mused mr pumblechook aloud â\\x80\\x9cand\\nyet when he went from here i may say with my blessing and i spread\\nafore him my humble store like the bee he was as plump as a peachâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthis reminded me of the wonderful difference between the servile manner\\nin which he had offered his hand in my new prosperity saying â\\x80\\x9cmay iâ\\x80\\x9d\\nand the ostentatious clemency with which he had just now exhibited the\\nsame fat five fingers\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9chahâ\\x80\\x9d he went on handing me the bread and butter â\\x80\\x9cand air you\\nagoing to josephâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cin heavenâ\\x80\\x99s nameâ\\x80\\x9d said i firing in spite of myself â\\x80\\x9cwhat does it\\nmatter to you where i am going leave that teapot aloneâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nit was the worst course i could have taken because it gave pumblechook\\nthe opportunity he wanted\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyes young manâ\\x80\\x9d said he releasing the handle of the article in\\nquestion retiring a step or two from my table and speaking for the\\nbehoof of the landlord and waiter at the door â\\x80\\x9ci will leave that\\nteapot alone you are right young man for once you are right i\\nforgit myself when i take such an interest in your breakfast as to\\nwish your frame exhausted by the debilitating effects of\\nprodigygality to be stimilated by the â\\x80\\x99olesome nourishment of your\\nforefathers and yetâ\\x80\\x9d said pumblechook turning to the landlord and\\nwaiter and pointing me out at armâ\\x80\\x99s length â\\x80\\x9cthis is him as i ever\\nsported with in his days of happy infancy tell me not it cannot be i\\ntell you this is himâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\na low murmur from the two replied the waiter appeared to be\\nparticularly affected\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthis is himâ\\x80\\x9d said pumblechook â\\x80\\x9cas i have rode in my shaycart this\\nis him as i have seen brought up by hand this is him untoe the sister\\nof which i was uncle by marriage as her name was georgiana mâ\\x80\\x99ria from\\nher own mother let him deny it if he canâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthe waiter seemed convinced that i could not deny it and that it gave\\nthe case a black look\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyoung manâ\\x80\\x9d said pumblechook screwing his head at me in the old\\nfashion â\\x80\\x9cyou air agoing to joseph what does it matter to me you ask\\nme where you air agoing i say to you sir you air agoing to\\njosephâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthe waiter coughed as if he modestly invited me to get over that\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnowâ\\x80\\x9d said pumblechook and all this with a most exasperating air of\\nsaying in the cause of virtue what was perfectly convincing and\\nconclusive â\\x80\\x9ci will tell you what to say to joseph here is squires of\\nthe boar present known and respected in this town and here is\\nwilliam which his fatherâ\\x80\\x99s name was potkins if i do not deceive\\nmyselfâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou do not sirâ\\x80\\x9d said william\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cin their presenceâ\\x80\\x9d pursued pumblechook â\\x80\\x9ci will tell you young man\\nwhat to say to joseph says you â\\x80\\x9cjoseph i have this day seen my\\nearliest benefactor and the founder of my fortunâ\\x80\\x99s i will name no\\nnames joseph but so they are pleased to call him up town and i have\\nseen that manâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci swear i donâ\\x80\\x99t see him hereâ\\x80\\x9d said i\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9csay that likewiseâ\\x80\\x9d retorted pumblechook â\\x80\\x9csay you said that and even\\njoseph will probably betray surpriseâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthere you quite mistake himâ\\x80\\x9d said i â\\x80\\x9ci know betterâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9csays youâ\\x80\\x9d pumblechook went on â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98joseph i have seen that man and\\nthat man bears you no malice and bears me no malice he knows your\\ncharacter joseph and is well acquainted with your pigheadedness and\\nignorance and he knows my character joseph and he knows my want of\\ngratitoode yes josephâ\\x80\\x99 says youâ\\x80\\x9d here pumblechook shook his head\\nand hand at me â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98he knows my total deficiency of common human\\ngratitoode he knows it joseph as none can you do not know it\\njoseph having no call to know it but that man doâ\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nwindy donkey as he was it really amazed me that he could have the face\\nto talk thus to mine\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9csays you â\\x80\\x98joseph he gave me a little message which i will now\\nrepeat it was that in my being brought low he saw the finger of\\nprovidence he knowed that finger when he saw joseph and he saw it\\nplain it pinted out this writing joseph reward of ingratitoode to\\nhis earliest benefactor and founder of fortunâ\\x80\\x99s but that man said he\\ndid not repent of what he had done joseph not at all it was right to\\ndo it it was kind to do it it was benevolent to do it and he would\\ndo it againâ\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s pityâ\\x80\\x9d said i scornfully as i finished my interrupted\\nbreakfast â\\x80\\x9cthat the man did not say what he had done and would do\\nagainâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9csquires of the boarâ\\x80\\x9d pumblechook was now addressing the landlord\\nâ\\x80\\x9cand william i have no objections to your mentioning either up town\\nor down town if such should be your wishes that it was right to do\\nit kind to do it benevolent to do it and that i would do it againâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nwith those words the impostor shook them both by the hand with an air\\nand left the house leaving me much more astonished than delighted by\\nthe virtues of that same indefinite â\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x9d i was not long after him in\\nleaving the house too and when i went down the high street i saw him\\nholding forth no doubt to the same effect at his shop door to a\\nselect group who honoured me with very unfavourable glances as i\\npassed on the opposite side of the way\\n\\nbut it was only the pleasanter to turn to biddy and to joe whose\\ngreat forbearance shone more brightly than before if that could be\\ncontrasted with this brazen pretender i went towards them slowly for\\nmy limbs were weak but with a sense of increasing relief as i drew\\nnearer to them and a sense of leaving arrogance and untruthfulness\\nfurther and further behind\\n\\nthe june weather was delicious the sky was blue the larks were\\nsoaring high over the green corn i thought all that countryside more\\nbeautiful and peaceful by far than i had ever known it to be yet many\\npleasant pictures of the life that i would lead there and of the\\nchange for the better that would come over my character when i had a\\nguiding spirit at my side whose simple faith and clear home wisdom i\\nhad proved beguiled my way they awakened a tender emotion in me for\\nmy heart was softened by my return and such a change had come to pass\\nthat i felt like one who was toiling home barefoot from distant travel\\nand whose wanderings had lasted many years\\n\\nthe schoolhouse where biddy was mistress i had never seen but the\\nlittle roundabout lane by which i entered the village for quietnessâ\\x80\\x99\\nsake took me past it i was disappointed to find that the day was a\\nholiday no children were there and biddyâ\\x80\\x99s house was closed some\\nhopeful notion of seeing her busily engaged in her daily duties\\nbefore she saw me had been in my mind and was defeated\\n\\nbut the forge was a very short distance off and i went towards it\\nunder the sweet green limes listening for the clink of joeâ\\x80\\x99s hammer\\nlong after i ought to have heard it and long after i had fancied i\\nheard it and found it but a fancy all was still the limes were there\\nand the white thorns were there and the chestnuttrees were there and\\ntheir leaves rustled harmoniously when i stopped to listen but the\\nclink of joeâ\\x80\\x99s hammer was not in the midsummer wind\\n\\nalmost fearing without knowing why to come in view of the forge i\\nsaw it at last and saw that it was closed no gleam of fire no\\nglittering shower of sparks no roar of bellows all shut up and\\nstill\\n\\nbut the house was not deserted and the best parlour seemed to be in\\nuse for there were white curtains fluttering in its window and the\\nwindow was open and gay with flowers i went softly towards it meaning\\nto peep over the flowers when joe and biddy stood before me arm in\\narm\\n\\nat first biddy gave a cry as if she thought it was my apparition but\\nin another moment she was in my embrace i wept to see her and she\\nwept to see me i because she looked so fresh and pleasant she\\nbecause i looked so worn and white\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbut dear biddy how smart you areâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyes dear pipâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cand joe how smart you areâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyes dear old pip old chapâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni looked at both of them from one to the other and thenâ\\x80\\x94\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s my weddingdayâ\\x80\\x9d cried biddy in a burst of happiness â\\x80\\x9cand i am\\nmarried to joeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthey had taken me into the kitchen and i had laid my head down on the\\nold deal table biddy held one of my hands to her lips and joeâ\\x80\\x99s\\nrestoring touch was on my shoulder â\\x80\\x9cwhich he warnâ\\x80\\x99t strong enough my\\ndear fur to be surprisedâ\\x80\\x9d said joe and biddy said â\\x80\\x9ci ought to have\\nthought of it dear joe but i was too happyâ\\x80\\x9d they were both so\\noverjoyed to see me so proud to see me so touched by my coming to\\nthem so delighted that i should have come by accident to make their\\nday complete\\n\\nmy first thought was one of great thankfulness that i had never\\nbreathed this last baffled hope to joe how often while he was with me\\nin my illness had it risen to my lips how irrevocable would have been\\nhis knowledge of it if he had remained with me but another hour\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cdear biddyâ\\x80\\x9d said i â\\x80\\x9cyou have the best husband in the whole world\\nand if you could have seen him by my bed you would haveâ\\x80\\x94but no you\\ncouldnâ\\x80\\x99t love him better than you doâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cno i couldnâ\\x80\\x99t indeedâ\\x80\\x9d said biddy\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cand dear joe you have the best wife in the whole world and she will\\nmake you as happy as even you deserve to be you dear good noble\\njoeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\njoe looked at me with a quivering lip and fairly put his sleeve before\\nhis eyes\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cand joe and biddy both as you have been to church today and are in\\ncharity and love with all mankind receive my humble thanks for all you\\nhave done for me and all i have so ill repaid and when i say that i\\nam going away within the hour for i am soon going abroad and that i\\nshall never rest until i have worked for the money with which you have\\nkept me out of prison and have sent it to you donâ\\x80\\x99t think dear joe\\nand biddy that if i could repay it a thousand times over i suppose i\\ncould cancel a farthing of the debt i owe you or that i would do so if\\ni couldâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthey were both melted by these words and both entreated me to say no\\nmore\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbut i must say more dear joe i hope you will have children to love\\nand that some little fellow will sit in this chimneycorner of a winter\\nnight who may remind you of another little fellow gone out of it for\\never donâ\\x80\\x99t tell him joe that i was thankless donâ\\x80\\x99t tell him biddy\\nthat i was ungenerous and unjust only tell him that i honoured you\\nboth because you were both so good and true and that as your child\\ni said it would be natural to him to grow up a much better man than i\\ndidâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci ainâ\\x80\\x99t agoingâ\\x80\\x9d said joe from behind his sleeve â\\x80\\x9cto tell him\\nnothink oâ\\x80\\x99 that natur pip nor biddy ainâ\\x80\\x99t nor yet no one ainâ\\x80\\x99tâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cand now though i know you have already done it in your own kind\\nhearts pray tell me both that you forgive me pray let me hear you\\nsay the words that i may carry the sound of them away with me and\\nthen i shall be able to believe that you can trust me and think better\\nof me in the time to comeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9co dear old pip old chapâ\\x80\\x9d said joe â\\x80\\x9cgod knows as i forgive you if i\\nhave anythink to forgiveâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9camen and god knows i doâ\\x80\\x9d echoed biddy\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnow let me go up and look at my old little room and rest there a few\\nminutes by myself and then when i have eaten and drunk with you go\\nwith me as far as the fingerpost dear joe and biddy before we say\\ngoodbyeâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ni sold all i had and put aside as much as i could for a composition\\nwith my creditorsâ\\x80\\x94who gave me ample time to pay them in fullâ\\x80\\x94and i\\nwent out and joined herbert within a month i had quitted england and\\nwithin two months i was clerk to clarriker and co and within four\\nmonths i assumed my first undivided responsibility for the beam across\\nthe parlour ceiling at mill pond bank had then ceased to tremble under\\nold bill barleyâ\\x80\\x99s growls and was at peace and herbert had gone away to\\nmarry clara and i was left in sole charge of the eastern branch until\\nhe brought her back\\n\\nmany a year went round before i was a partner in the house but i lived\\nhappily with herbert and his wife and lived frugally and paid my\\ndebts and maintained a constant correspondence with biddy and joe it\\nwas not until i became third in the firm that clarriker betrayed me to\\nherbert but he then declared that the secret of herbertâ\\x80\\x99s partnership\\nhad been long enough upon his conscience and he must tell it so he\\ntold it and herbert was as much moved as amazed and the dear fellow\\nand i were not the worse friends for the long concealment i must not\\nleave it to be supposed that we were ever a great house or that we\\nmade mints of money we were not in a grand way of business but we had\\na good name and worked for our profits and did very well we owed so\\nmuch to herbertâ\\x80\\x99s ever cheerful industry and readiness that i often\\nwondered how i had conceived that old idea of his inaptitude until i\\nwas one day enlightened by the reflection that perhaps the inaptitude\\nhad never been in him at all but had been in me\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter lix\\n\\n\\nfor eleven years i had not seen joe nor biddy with my bodily\\neyesâ\\x80\\x94though they had both been often before my fancy in the\\neastâ\\x80\\x94when upon an evening in december an hour or two after dark i\\nlaid my hand softly on the latch of the old kitchen door i touched it\\nso softly that i was not heard and looked in unseen there smoking\\nhis pipe in the old place by the kitchen firelight as hale and as\\nstrong as ever though a little grey sat joe and there fenced into\\nthe corner with joeâ\\x80\\x99s leg and sitting on my own little stool looking\\nat the fire wasâ\\x80\\x94i again\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwe givâ\\x80\\x99 him the name of pip for your sake dear old chapâ\\x80\\x9d said joe\\ndelighted when i took another stool by the childâ\\x80\\x99s side but i did\\nnot rumple his hair â\\x80\\x9cand we hoped he might grow a little bit like\\nyou and we think he doâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\ni thought so too and i took him out for a walk next morning and we\\ntalked immensely understanding one another to perfection and i took\\nhim down to the churchyard and set him on a certain tombstone there\\nand he showed me from that elevation which stone was sacred to the\\nmemory of philip pirrip late of this parish and also georgiana wife\\nof the above\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbiddyâ\\x80\\x9d said i when i talked with her after dinner as her little\\ngirl lay sleeping in her lap â\\x80\\x9cyou must give pip to me one of these\\ndays or lend him at all eventsâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cno noâ\\x80\\x9d said biddy gently â\\x80\\x9cyou must marryâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cso herbert and clara say but i donâ\\x80\\x99t think i shall biddy i have so\\nsettled down in their home that itâ\\x80\\x99s not at all likely i am already\\nquite an old bachelorâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nbiddy looked down at her child and put its little hand to her lips\\nand then put the good matronly hand with which she had touched it into\\nmine there was something in the action and in the light pressure of\\nbiddyâ\\x80\\x99s weddingring that had a very pretty eloquence in it\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cdear pipâ\\x80\\x9d said biddy â\\x80\\x9cyou are sure you donâ\\x80\\x99t fret for herâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9co noâ\\x80\\x94i think not biddyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ctell me as an old old friend have you quite forgotten her\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmy dear biddy i have forgotten nothing in my life that ever had a\\nforemost place there and little that ever had any place there but\\nthat poor dream as i once used to call it has all gone by biddyâ\\x80\\x94all\\ngone byâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nnevertheless i knew while i said those words that i secretly\\nintended to revisit the site of the old house that evening alone for\\nher sake yes even so for estellaâ\\x80\\x99s sake\\n\\ni had heard of her as leading a most unhappy life and as being\\nseparated from her husband who had used her with great cruelty and\\nwho had become quite renowned as a compound of pride avarice\\nbrutality and meanness and i had heard of the death of her husband\\nfrom an accident consequent on his illtreatment of a horse this\\nrelease had befallen her some two years before for anything i knew\\nshe was married again\\n\\nthe early dinner hour at joeâ\\x80\\x99s left me abundance of time without\\nhurrying my talk with biddy to walk over to the old spot before dark\\nbut what with loitering on the way to look at old objects and to think\\nof old times the day had quite declined when i came to the place\\n\\nthere was no house now no brewery no building whatever left but the\\nwall of the old garden the cleared space had been enclosed with a\\nrough fence and looking over it i saw that some of the old ivy had\\nstruck root anew and was growing green on low quiet mounds of ruin a\\ngate in the fence standing ajar i pushed it open and went in\\n\\na cold silvery mist had veiled the afternoon and the moon was not yet\\nup to scatter it but the stars were shining beyond the mist and the\\nmoon was coming and the evening was not dark i could trace out where\\nevery part of the old house had been and where the brewery had been\\nand where the gates and where the casks i had done so and was\\nlooking along the desolate garden walk when i beheld a solitary figure\\nin it\\n\\nthe figure showed itself aware of me as i advanced it had been moving\\ntowards me but it stood still as i drew nearer i saw it to be the\\nfigure of a woman as i drew nearer yet it was about to turn away\\nwhen it stopped and let me come up with it then it faltered as if\\nmuch surprised and uttered my name and i cried outâ\\x80\\x94\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cestellaâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ci am greatly changed i wonder you know meâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthe freshness of her beauty was indeed gone but its indescribable\\nmajesty and its indescribable charm remained those attractions in it\\ni had seen before what i had never seen before was the saddened\\nsoftened light of the once proud eyes what i had never felt before was\\nthe friendly touch of the once insensible hand\\n\\nwe sat down on a bench that was near and i said â\\x80\\x9cafter so many years\\nit is strange that we should thus meet again estella here where our\\nfirst meeting was do you often come
